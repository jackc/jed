## Definition of done (applies to every feature item)

A feature is a **vertical slice** (CLAUDE.md §10), and "done" means **all** of:

1. **Spec first** — the canonical artifact is updated: grammar (`spec/grammar/`), type
   data (`spec/types/`), operator/function catalog (`spec/functions/`), error registry
   (`spec/errors/`), and/or design doc (`spec/design/`) — *before* the executor.
2. **All native cores in lockstep** — Rust, Go, **and** TS (§2). No core leads the spec.
3. **Conformance corpus** — new `.test` entries + a `# requires:` capability (and, where
   it's a milestone, a profile) in `spec/conformance/manifest.toml`. The corpus is the
   contract (§7), not an afterthought.
4. **Determinism** — defined ordering, structured error codes, no float/iteration-order
   leakage (§8, §10).
5. **PostgreSQL behavior by default** — where the feature has a choice and one option matches
   PostgreSQL, take it unless there's a documented overriding reason (CLAUDE.md §1). Any
   deliberate divergence from PG is recorded in the relevant spec doc.

Difficulty key: **S** ≈ hours · **M** ≈ a day · **L** ≈ multi-day · **XL** ≈ a project.

## Phase 0 — Meta / housekeeping

- [x] **Name the project.** Settled on **`jed`** (was the placeholder `abide`). Swept the
      codebase + docs: Cargo crate, Go module/package, TS package, the on-disk magic
      (`ABDB` → `JEDB`), the file extension (`.adb` → `.jed`), and the devcontainer
      identifiers (`devstate-shared-jed`, `/workspaces/jed`). _(size: S)_

---

## Phase 1 — Foundations: spec backfill + the expression substrate

> Highest leverage, mostly low difficulty. These unblock nearly every later feature and
> close gaps in the *canonical artifact itself* (two spec dirs are still empty).

- [x] **Backfill the EBNF grammar.** The grammar is the shared contract the hand-written
      parsers conform to (§5/§6); three parsers previously existed with no authored grammar.
      Done: [spec/grammar/grammar.ebnf](spec/grammar/grammar.ebnf) (W3C-style EBNF) covers the
      already-implemented surface (CREATE TABLE / INSERT / SELECT / WHERE / ORDER BY / UPDATE /
      DELETE / CAST), with the *why* in [spec/design/grammar.md](spec/design/grammar.md). Grow
      it per feature. _(size: M; §6)_
- [x] **Author the function / operator catalog.** Operator **result types** (e.g. type of
      `int32 + int32`) and NULL behavior live here as data (§5). Done:
      [spec/functions/catalog.toml](spec/functions/catalog.toml) backfills the comparison
      operators (`= < > <= >=`) and null tests (`IS [NOT] NULL`) the cores hardcode, with a
      family-based schema that references the promotion tower rather than restating it, a
      coherence checker ([spec/functions/verify.rb](spec/functions/verify.rb), wired into
      `rake verify`), and the *why* in [spec/design/functions.md](spec/design/functions.md).
      Prerequisite for all arithmetic/boolean/function work. _(size: M; §5)_
- [x] **Decide & build the codegen "middle path"** for the function catalog (§5). Decided:
      codegen emits **data only** (a per-language operator descriptor table from
      `spec/functions/catalog.toml`); the parser/executor/evaluator that consume it stay
      hand-written (§5 forbids codegenning those). Done: [scripts/gen_catalog.rb](scripts/gen_catalog.rb)
      (`rake codegen`) emits `impl/{rust/src,go,ts/src}/operators.{rs,go,ts}` (checked-in,
      `@generated`); a `rake verify` drift gate + per-core cross-check tests keep them in
      sync; the *why* is in [spec/design/codegen.md](spec/design/codegen.md). Forward: extend
      the generator to types/errors. _(size: M; §5)_ _(parallel)_
- [x] **Resolve integer-literal typing.** Decided **context-adaptive**: a bare integer
      literal is an *untyped constant* that adapts to its context (the column on
      INSERT/UPDATE/comparison, the CAST target) and traps `22003` when its value does not
      fit, defaulting to int64 with no context. Authored in
      [spec/design/types.md](spec/design/types.md) §6 (conformance.md §7 flipped to
      resolved); the one new code path is a literal range-check in each core's WHERE-predicate
      resolution (so `WHERE small = 100000` now traps instead of silently matching nothing),
      pinned by [spec/conformance/suites/types/literals.test](spec/conformance/suites/types/literals.test).
      _(size: S; §4)_
- [x] **General expression evaluator.** Done: a unified recursive `Expr` (Column/Literal/
      Cast/Unary/Binary/IsNull) replaced the split `Operand`/`Predicate`/`SelectExpr`, with a
      one-function-per-level precedence parser and a recursive resolve→eval in all three cores,
      shared by WHERE and the SELECT list (parenthesization included). Landed **together** with
      the next three items as one slice (the substrate is only testable with operators on it);
      function-call syntax stays deferred (no scalar functions defined yet). _(was: L; §5)_
- [x] **Integer arithmetic operators** `+ - * / %` and unary `-`, trap-on-overflow (`22003`)
      at the **result type's** boundary (`int16+int16` traps at int16), defined `/`/`%`-by-zero
      (`22012`); result types from the promotion tower. Authored in the catalog (kind
      `arithmetic`, result `promoted`) + `spec/conformance/suites/expr/{arithmetic,unary_minus}.test`.
      _(was: M; §4/§8)_
- [x] **`boolean` scalar type** — **expression-only** this slice (the first non-integer scalar):
      `TRUE`/`FALSE` literals, comparison/logical results, projectable in SELECT, consumed by
      WHERE; render tag `B` (`true`/`false`). It is **not yet a storable column type** (see the
      storable-boolean follow-on in Phase 3). _(was: M; §4)_
- [x] **Logical connectives `AND` / `OR` / `NOT`** with three-valued (Kleene) truth tables —
      `AND`/`OR` are `null = "kleene"` (a dominant operand absorbs NULL), `NOT` propagates.
      Coverage in `spec/conformance/suites/expr/{logical,precedence}.test`. _(was: M; deps: boolean ✓)_
- [x] **`IS [NOT] DISTINCT FROM`** — NULL-safe equality. Done: a new `null = "null_safe"`
      operator pair in [spec/functions/catalog.toml](spec/functions/catalog.toml) (same
      `integer × integer` `promote` contract and `boolean` result as `=`; only the NULL
      handling is total — `NULL IS NOT DISTINCT FROM NULL` is TRUE, the result is never
      unknown). The shared `IS` `NOT`? prefix dispatches on `NULL` vs `DISTINCT FROM` in the
      grammar ([spec/grammar/grammar.ebnf](spec/grammar/grammar.ebnf) `comparison`,
      non-associative) and in all three parsers; one `not_distinct_from` value primitive +
      one resolved node per core (reusing the `=` operand resolution). Pinned by
      [spec/conformance/suites/expr/is_distinct_from.test](spec/conformance/suites/expr/is_distinct_from.test)
      (`query.is_distinct_from`, in the `expression` profile). The why is in
      [functions.md](spec/design/functions.md) §3 / [types.md](spec/design/types.md) §4.
      _(size: S; deps: boolean ✓)_
- [x] **Cost-accounting seam (design early, enforce later).** Done (the **seam**; enforcement
      still deferred): a deterministic cost counter (`Meter`) threads through the executor /
      expression evaluator / storage reads in all three cores, accruing from a data-defined unit
      schedule ([spec/cost/schedule.toml](spec/cost/schedule.toml): `storage_row_read`,
      `row_produced`, a uniform `operator_eval`; codegen'd to `costs.{rs,go,ts}` via
      [scripts/gen_costs.rb](scripts/gen_costs.rb), drift-gated by `rake verify`). Cost is exposed
      on `Outcome` and is a cross-core contract: the `# cost: N` corpus directive
      ([spec/conformance/suites/expr/cost.test](spec/conformance/suites/expr/cost.test), gated by
      the `resource.cost_metering` capability) asserts the **byte-identical** accrued cost in
      Rust, Go, **and** TS. The accrual rules (interior nodes only, no short-circuit, pre-order)
      and the deferred bits are in [spec/design/cost.md](spec/design/cost.md). **Still deferred:**
      the caller-set **max-cost ceiling + deterministic abort** (and its error code) — designed so
      `Meter.charge` is the single chokepoint where it slots in; a real `page_read` unit; and
      per-operator `cost` weights. _(was: M seam / L full enforcement; §13)_ _(parallel)_

---

## Phase 2 — Make it feel like SQL (core query/DML completeness)

> Builds directly on the Phase 1 expression substrate. High importance, mostly M.

- [x] **Select-list expressions + `*` + column aliases (`AS`).** Select-list expressions and
      `*` already worked; this added explicit `AS` aliases and, with them, **output column
      naming** as a cross-core contract. Done: the naming rule (bare column → catalog canonical
      name; `expr AS alias` → alias; `*` → column names; any other expression → the fixed
      `?column?`) authored in [spec/design/grammar.md](spec/design/grammar.md) §8 + the
      `select_item` production in [spec/grammar/grammar.ebnf](spec/grammar/grammar.ebnf); the
      query `Outcome` now carries `column_names` in all three cores (replacing the dead
      `column_count`), with aliases parsed as output-only labels (invisible to WHERE/ORDER BY);
      and a new `# names:` conformance directive (mirroring `# cost:`,
      [conformance.md](spec/design/conformance.md) §1) asserts the byte-identical names in Rust,
      Go, **and** TS, pinned by
      [spec/conformance/suites/query/select_list.test](spec/conformance/suites/query/select_list.test)
      (capabilities `query.column_alias` + `query.select_star`). _(size: M; deps: expression evaluator)_
- [x] **`LIMIT` / `OFFSET`.** Done: `LIMIT n` caps and `OFFSET m` skips result rows, the two
      clauses accepted in **either order**, each at most once (a duplicate is `42601`). The count
      is a **non-negative integer literal** (not a general expression); a negative value is a
      deterministic parse-time data error — **`2201W`** (LIMIT) / **`2201X`** (OFFSET), the
      PostgreSQL SQLSTATEs, added to [spec/errors/registry.toml](spec/errors/registry.toml). The
      slice runs **after `ORDER BY`, before projection**, so excluded rows are scanned + filtered
      but charge no `row_produced`/projection cost — a cross-core determinism contract pinned by
      the `# cost:` directive. Authored in [spec/grammar/grammar.ebnf](spec/grammar/grammar.ebnf)
      (`limit_offset`) + [grammar.md §9](spec/design/grammar.md), [cost.md §3](spec/design/cost.md),
      and capabilities `query.limit` + `query.offset` in
      [manifest.toml](spec/conformance/manifest.toml), all three cores in lockstep, pinned by
      [spec/conformance/suites/query/limit_offset.test](spec/conformance/suites/query/limit_offset.test).
      _(size: S)_
- [x] **Richer `ORDER BY`** — multiple keys, per-key `ASC`/`DESC`, `NULLS FIRST|LAST`. Done:
      `order_by` is now `sort_key ("," sort_key)*` with each key a **bare column** (ordinal /
      expression / alias keys still deferred), an optional direction, and an optional
      `NULLS FIRST|LAST`. The per-key comparator **decouples** NULL placement from the
      value-direction flip, so an explicit `NULLS FIRST|LAST` overrides regardless of
      direction; with no clause the default **follows the ratified physical order** —
      `ASC` → NULLs last, `DESC` → NULLs first (NULL = largest, the **PostgreSQL model**),
      resolved at parse time. The sort stays **unmetered**
      (cost.md §3), so the `# cost:` math is unchanged. Authored in
      [grammar.ebnf](spec/grammar/grammar.ebnf) (`order_by` / `sort_key`) +
      [grammar.md §10](spec/design/grammar.md), [types.md §4](spec/design/types.md), the new
      `query.order_by_keys` capability in [manifest.toml](spec/conformance/manifest.toml), all
      three cores in lockstep, pinned by
      [spec/conformance/suites/query/order_by.test](spec/conformance/suites/query/order_by.test).
      _(size: M)_
- [x] **`DISTINCT`.** Done: `SELECT DISTINCT` deduplicates the **projected** output rows
      (NULL-safe — two NULLs collapse, the `IS NOT DISTINCT FROM` rule, not three-valued `=`).
      It runs **after `ORDER BY`, before `LIMIT`/`OFFSET`** (the window slices the *distinct*
      rows), inverting the un-DISTINCT pipeline. Output order is deterministic: first-occurrence
      over the primary-key scan with no `ORDER BY`, else the keys order the distinct rows.
      `ORDER BY` under DISTINCT takes the **PostgreSQL restriction** — each key must be a bare
      column in the select list (or `*`), else the new **`42P10`**
      (`invalid_column_reference`, [registry.toml](spec/errors/registry.toml)); NULL ordering
      follows PostgreSQL too (NULL largest, `ASC` → NULLS LAST). The cost
      asymmetry ([cost.md §3](spec/design/cost.md)) is a cross-core contract: projection
      `operator_eval` is charged per **filtered** row (dedup must evaluate all), `row_produced`
      only per emitted distinct+windowed row, dedup unmetered — so `SELECT DISTINCT 1/a … LIMIT 1`
      traps `22012` where the un-DISTINCT form does not. `DISTINCT` is non-reserved (a column may
      be named `distinct`), disambiguated by a **two-token lookahead** byte-identical across the
      three parsers. Authored in [grammar.ebnf](spec/grammar/grammar.ebnf) (`select`) +
      [grammar.md §11](spec/design/grammar.md), capability `query.distinct` in
      [manifest.toml](spec/conformance/manifest.toml), all three cores in lockstep, pinned by
      [spec/conformance/suites/query/distinct.test](spec/conformance/suites/query/distinct.test).
      _(size: S–M)_
- [x] **Predicate forms** — `IN (list)`, `BETWEEN`, `LIKE`, `CASE`. Done in **four vertical
      slices** (all three cores in lockstep), all edge cases verified against the live `postgres:18`
      oracle. (1) **`IN (list)` / `NOT IN`** and (2) **`BETWEEN` / `NOT BETWEEN`** are non-associative
      postfix forms at the comparison level (a two-token `NOT` lookahead), **desugared at resolve**
      into the existing `=`/`OR`/`AND`/`NOT` nodes — so three-valued NULL (`1 IN (2,NULL)` is NULL;
      the Kleene-AND `5 BETWEEN 10 AND NULL` is FALSE), per-element/bound typing (22003/42804), and
      cost all fall out (the LHS is re-evaluated per element/bound). BETWEEN's bounds parse at the
      additive level so the structural `AND` is not the connective. (3) **`LIKE` / `NOT LIKE`** is a
      genuine catalog operator (text×text→boolean) with a hand-written **code-point** matcher (`%`/`_`,
      default `\` escape) — `'😀x' LIKE '_x'` is TRUE; a pattern ending in a lone escape *reached
      during matching* traps the new **`22025`** lazily (matching PG). (4) **`CASE`** (searched +
      simple) is the engine's first **lazy** expression and the one sanctioned no-short-circuit
      exception (cost.md §3): first-TRUE wins, later arms unevaluated; result arms unify (numeric
      promote, all-NULL → text, cross-family 42804). Authored spec-first: grammar.ebnf + grammar.md
      §20–§23, cost.md §3 (CASE exception), error `22025`, the `like` catalog operator (+ codegen,
      verify.rb), capabilities `expr.{in_list,between,like,case}` + the `predicates` profile; pinned
      by `spec/conformance/suites/expr/{in_list,between,like,case}.test` (50/0/0 byte-identical in
      Rust, Go, TS, `# cost:`/`# names:` asserted). **Deferred narrowings:** `IN (subquery)` (Phase 4
      subqueries); LIKE `ESCAPE 'c'` clause, `ILIKE`, `SIMILAR TO`; CASE integer-arm width follows our
      default (int64) rather than PG's exact promoted width (unobservable — all integers render `I`).
      _(was: M; LIKE deps: text type ✓)_
- [x] **Aggregates** `COUNT` / `SUM` / `MIN` / `MAX` / `AVG` + **`GROUP BY`** + **`HAVING`**.
      Done in **three vertical slices** (all three cores in lockstep): (1) the engine's first
      **function-call syntax** (`name ( * | expr )`, one-token lookahead so names stay
      non-reserved; only aggregates resolve, unknown → `42883`, `DISTINCT`-in-aggregate →
      `42601`) + **whole-table aggregation** (one result row, even over an empty table); (2)
      **`GROUP BY`** (bare/qualified columns, value-canonical bucketing so `1.5`/`1.50` and NULL
      group correctly, first-occurrence order, the **grouping-error rule** `42803`, `ORDER BY`
      over grouping keys); (3) **`HAVING`** (boolean filter over grouped rows, after aggregation
      before ORDER BY, may reference unprojected aggregates). **PostgreSQL widening** (verified
      against the live `postgres:18` oracle): `COUNT`→`int64`; `SUM(int16/int32)`→`int64`,
      `SUM(int64)`→`decimal`, `SUM(decimal)`→`decimal`; `AVG(any numeric)`→`decimal` via the
      exact decimal division; `MIN`/`MAX`→input type; NULL inputs skipped (COUNT(\*) counts
      rows), overflow traps `22003`. New canonical data: a `[[aggregate]]` array
      (`kind = "aggregate"`) in [catalog.toml](spec/functions/catalog.toml) with its own
      verify.rb branch + codegen `AGGREGATES` table; errors `42803`/`42883`; cost unit
      `aggregate_accumulate`; design doc [aggregates.md](spec/design/aggregates.md);
      [grammar.md](spec/design/grammar.md) §17–§19; capabilities `query.aggregates` /
      `query.group_by` / `query.having` + profiles `aggregates`/`grouping`/`having`; conformance
      [suites/aggregates/](spec/conformance/suites/aggregates/) (`count`/`sum`/`min_max`/`avg`/
      `whole_table`/`group_by`/`having`), 46/0/0 byte-identical in Rust, Go, and TS with
      `# cost:` / `# names:` pinned. Deferred: `COUNT(DISTINCT x)`, `SELECT DISTINCT` in an
      aggregate query, GROUP BY by expression/ordinal/alias, the functional-dependency grouping
      relaxation, `GROUPING SETS`/`FILTER`/ordered-set aggregates. _(size: L; deps: expression evaluator)_
- [x] **Scalar functions** `abs` / `round` — the first named per-row functions. Done across
      Rust/Go/TS (conformance 54/54 byte-identical, PG-oracle-verified).
      Authored as `[[operator]]` rows with `kind = "function"` (reusing the operator mold,
      [functions.md](spec/design/functions.md) §9; no symbol/precedence), so codegen +
      verify.rb + the `spec_constants` drift tests accept them unchanged. The shared
      `function_call` grammar generalizes its argument to a **comma-separated list**
      (`abs(x)`, `round(x)`, `round(x, n)`) — the `FuncCall`/`FuncCallExpr` AST node goes from
      a single `arg` to an `args` list across all three cores — and the resolver splits
      aggregate vs scalar vs unknown (`42883`). `abs` → operand type, range-checks at the
      result boundary (`abs(int16 -32768)` → `22003`); `round` → numeric, half-away to scale 0
      or `n`, with explicit integer overloads so PG's `round(5)` works (no implicit coercion).
      Scalar functions are valid **anywhere an expression is** (incl. `WHERE`), unlike
      aggregates; one `operator_eval` per call. Capabilities `func.abs`/`func.round` + profile
      `functions`; conformance
      [suites/expr/scalar_functions.test](spec/conformance/suites/expr/scalar_functions.test).
      No new type / on-disk-format change. Follow-ons: `ceil`/`floor`/`mod`/`sign`, text
      `length`/`lower`/`upper`, a general implicit argument-coercion pass. _(size: M; deps: expression evaluator, decimal)_
- [x] **Multi-row `INSERT`** (`VALUES (..),(..)`). Done: `INSERT INTO t VALUES (..),(..)`
      accepts one or more parenthesized rows, **two-phase / all-or-nothing** like `UPDATE`
      (CLAUDE.md §11 step 6) — every row is fully validated (arity → `42601`, type/range →
      `22003`, NOT NULL → `23502`) and every storage key checked for a duplicate (`23505`,
      against both stored rows **and** earlier rows in the same batch) **before any row is
      inserted**, so a mid-batch failure stores nothing. Synthetic rowids (no-PK tables) are
      allocated in phase two, in row order, so a failed batch burns none. The `Insert` AST
      went from one `values` row to `rows: [][]Literal` across all three cores. Authored in
      [grammar.ebnf](spec/grammar/grammar.ebnf) (`insert` / `row`) +
      [grammar.md §12](spec/design/grammar.md), capability `dml.insert_multi_row` in
      [manifest.toml](spec/conformance/manifest.toml), all three cores in lockstep, pinned by
      [spec/conformance/suites/dml/insert_multi_row.test](spec/conformance/suites/dml/insert_multi_row.test).
      _(size: S)_
- [x] **`INSERT ... SELECT`** — insert the rows a query produces (the second half of the
      original multi-row-INSERT item). Done: the `insert` grammar source is now
      `( VALUES ... | select )` ([grammar.ebnf](spec/grammar/grammar.ebnf),
      [grammar.md](spec/design/grammar.md) §24); the executor feeds the SELECT result set through
      the same two-phase, all-or-nothing validation as VALUES (a shared `insertRows` /
      `insert_rows` helper across all three cores). Two checks run **up front, before any row is
      produced** (so they fire even over an empty source — the full-PG behaviour): output **arity**
      must match the target (`42601`) and each projected column's **type** must be assignable to its
      target (`42804`, the family-level subset of `store_value`, surfaced by threading projection
      types out of `resolveProjections` via an internal `runSelect`/`SelectResult` — the public
      `Outcome` is unchanged). Cost = the embedded SELECT's accrued cost (not the VALUES form's
      zero); the source is materialized first, so a self-insert reads the pre-insert snapshot. New
      capability `dml.insert_select` (in the `constraints` profile); pinned by
      [spec/conformance/suites/dml/insert_select.test](spec/conformance/suites/dml/insert_select.test)
      (52/52 byte-identical across Rust/Go/TS). _(size: M; deps: SELECT ✓)_
- [x] **`DROP TABLE`.** Done: `DROP TABLE t` removes a table — its definition **and** all
      its rows — from the catalog (both the catalog entry and the per-table store, keyed by
      the lower-cased name; case-insensitive). The inverse of `CREATE TABLE`: dropping a
      table that does not exist traps **`42P01`** (`undefined_table`, the same code the DML
      paths raise), mirroring CREATE's `42P07`-on-duplicate. After a drop the name is free to
      re-create from empty. Cost is **zero** (a pure catalog edit — no rows read, no
      expression tree, the store discarded wholesale). Deliberate narrowings, each relaxable
      later: **no `IF EXISTS`** (kept symmetric with the still-missing `CREATE TABLE IF NOT
      EXISTS`), **single table** (no `DROP TABLE a, b`), and **no `CASCADE`/`RESTRICT`** (no
      dependent objects exist yet). Authored in [grammar.ebnf](spec/grammar/grammar.ebnf)
      (`sql_statement` / `drop_table`) + [grammar.md §13](spec/design/grammar.md), capability
      `ddl.drop_table` in [manifest.toml](spec/conformance/manifest.toml), all three cores in
      lockstep, pinned by
      [spec/conformance/suites/ddl/drop_table.test](spec/conformance/suites/ddl/drop_table.test)
      (the first `ddl/` suite). _(size: S)_

## Phase 3 — The type system as the product (the differentiator, §4)

> The **real type system** is the product (§4) — PostgreSQL's behavior, stricter than its
> typing, and nothing like SQLite's runtime affinity. Each item is a vertical slice that
> forces a §8 divergence decision into the open (default: match PG — §1). `text` (collation
> `C`), `decimal` (exact base-10, half-away rounding), `bytea` (unsigned byte order, `\x`-hex
> literals), `uuid` (fixed 16 bytes, PG-flexible input, and the **first non-integer `PRIMARY
> KEY`**), and `timestamp`/`timestamptz` (int64-µs instant model, no tz database) are all done;
> `json`/`array` are the remaining headline items.

- [x] **Storable `boolean` column type** — done & committed across Rust/Go/TS. `boolean` was
      expression-only (Phase 1); it is now a *column* type: `CREATE TABLE t(flag boolean)`,
      `INSERT`/store/retrieve of `false`/`true`/`NULL`, `boolean × boolean` comparison
      (`= < > <= >=`, `IS [NOT] DISTINCT FROM`) and `ORDER BY` (false `<` true, NULLs last).
      On-disk type code `5` (codes 1–4 are int16/int32/int64/**text**) with the 1-byte `bool-byte`
      value codec, byte-exact across cores (golden `bool_table.jed`); capability
      `types.boolean_storable`; corpus `spec/conformance/suites/types/boolean.test`. Cleanly
      additive (old files keep working). Two deliberate narrowings remain (below). _(size: M;
      §4/§8/§9)_
  - [ ] **boolean in a key / `PRIMARY KEY`** — rejected `0A000` this slice; the order-preserving
        `bool-byte` key rule is authored (`scalars.toml`) but unexercised. Lifting it adds the
        executor key path + `bool-byte` key-encoding byte-vectors. _(size: S)_
  - [ ] **boolean⇄integer casts** — `CAST(x AS boolean)` / `CAST(bool AS int)` rejected
        (`0A000` / `42804`); not in the cast matrix. PostgreSQL's are asymmetric (bool→int yes,
        int→bool no), so authored in a dedicated cast slice, not here. _(size: S; §5)_
- [x] **`text` + ONE defined collation** — done & committed across Rust/Go/TS. Collation is
      PostgreSQL `C` (UTF-8 byte / code-point order; `scalars.toml` records the type with
      `collation = "C"`). Storage + single-quoted literals (`''` escaping) + comparison/ordering
      (`= < > <= >=`, `IS [NOT] DISTINCT FROM`); on-disk type code 4 with a compact value codec
      (u16 len + UTF-8 bytes), byte-exact across cores (golden `text_table.jed`). First operator
      **overload** (`=` over integer & text) — `catalog.toml` carries one row per `(name,
      arg_families)`; `functions/verify.rb` and the per-core drift tests key on the signature.
      The UTF-8-vs-UTF-16 ordering trap is handled in TS (`compareTextC` encodes to UTF-8, never
      JS `<`) and pinned by an astral-char conformance case. _(was: L; §4/§8; spec/design/types.md §11)_
      **Deferred follow-ups:** text in a `PRIMARY KEY` / index (the order-preserving
      terminator+escape key encoding is authored in `encoding.md §2.4` but unexercised — text PK
      is rejected `0A000`); `varchar(n)` length limits (`22001`); text⇄other casts; string
      functions (`||`, `length`, `lower`/`upper`, `substring`) + `LIKE`; multi-collation / ICU
      (a per-column catalog collation field + `COLLATE`).
- [x] **Exact `decimal`** — *the* headline type. Done across Rust/Go/TS: an exact base-10
      numeric held as hand-rolled sign + base-10⁹ coefficient + scale (no bignum lib, no float),
      the engine's **first parameterized type** (`numeric`, `numeric(p)`, `numeric(p,s)`;
      `1≤p≤1000`, `0≤s≤p`, bad typmod `22023`). Settles the §8 **decimal-rounding** hotspot:
      **round half away from zero** (PG `numeric`), one mode engine-wide, with PG-faithful
      result **scales** (add/sub `max(s1,s2)`, mul `s1+s2`, div `select_div_scale`, mod
      `max(s1,s2)`). Comparison/order by exact value (`1.5 = 1.50`), the first cross-family
      `integer↔decimal` promotion, casts (`int→decimal` implicit, `decimal→int` explicit-only —
      stricter than PG), arithmetic `+ − * / %` + unary `−`, on-disk value codec (type code 5,
      base-10⁴ groups), render tag `D`. **Finite only** — no NaN/±Infinity (documented PG
      divergence). Authored in [spec/design/decimal.md](spec/design/decimal.md) + the type/
      function/error/grammar data, capabilities `types.decimal` + `expr.decimal_arithmetic`,
      pinned by `spec/conformance/suites/types/decimal.test`,
      `spec/conformance/suites/expr/decimal_arithmetic.test`, and the byte-exact golden
      `spec/fileformat/fixtures/decimal_table.jed` (read/written identically by all three cores +
      the Ruby reference). `numeric.c` (Postgres) was the reference. _(was: XL; §4/§8)_
      **Deferred follow-ups:** decimal in a `PRIMARY KEY`/index (the order-preserving
      `decimal-order-preserving` key encoding is authored in `encoding.md §2.5` but unexercised
      — decimal PK is rejected `0A000`); scientific `e`-notation literals (`1.5e3`); negative /
      `s>p` scale typmods (PG 15+); `round(x,n)` and other decimal functions; raising the
      1000-digit / scale-1000 cap once over-page values (overflow pages / TOAST) land (Phase 6).
- [x] **`timestamp` / `timestamptz`** — done & committed across Rust/Go/TS (`1ee7027`). The
      PostgreSQL **instant** model (not the SQL-standard offset-bearing one): `timestamp` is a
      zoneless wall clock, `timestamptz` a UTC instant whose input offset normalizes to UTC then
      is **discarded**. Both are **int64 microseconds** since the Unix epoch (proleptic Gregorian,
      no leap seconds) — two distinct types sharing one physical representation (on-disk type codes
      **9** / **10**; they never compare or cast to each other → `42804`). Deliberately **no
      time-zone database / named zones** — kept deterministic + dependency-free (§8/§14, no
      wall-clock in tests); named-zone handling is left to the host. Calendar math is Hinnant
      `days_from_civil` / `civil_from_days`, authored once in
      [spec/design/timestamp.md](spec/design/timestamp.md) and transcribed identically into all
      three cores (the §8 determinism hotspot: civil↔days truncating, instant↔civil floor).
      `infinity` / `-infinity` are first-class (`i64::MIN`/`MAX` sentinels, totally ordered), so
      ordering, key encoding, and the on-disk codec handle them for free; **timestamp/timestamptz
      `PRIMARY KEY`** is supported (reuses the int64 order-preserving key codec). New errors
      `22007` / `22008`; capabilities `types.timestamp` / `types.timestamptz` + the `timestamps`
      profile; pinned by `spec/conformance/suites/types/{timestamp,timestamptz}.test` (38/0/0
      byte-identical in Rust, Go, TS) and the byte-exact goldens
      `{timestamp,timestamptz}_table.jed` (rust==go==ts==ruby). Oracle-verified vs PG 18.3 (all
      epoch values + renders match). **Two documented divergences (by design):** sub-µs rounding is
      **half-away** (jed's one rounding mode, no float in the value path) vs PG's half-even; a `:60`
      seconds field is **rejected** (strict) vs PG's roll-to-next-minute. _(was: L; §4;
      spec/design/timestamp.md, encoding/timestamps.toml)_ **Deferred follow-ups:** an `interval`
      type + timestamp arithmetic; date/time functions (`now()`/`current_timestamp`, `EXTRACT`,
      `date_trunc`, `age`); separate `date` / `time` types; named-zone `AT TIME ZONE` (needs the
      host-supplied tz database); timestamp⇄text/date casts; sub-second precision typmods
      (`timestamp(p)`).
- [x] **`bytea`** — done & committed across Rust/Go/TS. A variable-width binary string (raw
      bytes), compared by **unsigned byte order** (PostgreSQL's bytea comparison). Storage +
      `\x`-hex literals + comparison/ordering (`= < > <= >=`, `IS [NOT] DISTINCT FROM`); on-disk
      type code 7 with the same compact value codec as text (u16 len + raw bytes, no UTF-8
      validation), byte-exact across cores (golden `bytea_table.jed`). Another comparison
      operator **overload** (catalog.toml carries `bytea`-family rows). A bytea literal is a
      single-quoted string that **adapts to a bytea context** (the integer-literal
      context-adaptation rule of §6 extended to strings — `INSERT INTO t VALUES (1, '\xff')`,
      `WHERE b = '\xab'`; no cast needed); **hex input only** (`\x` + even hex digits), malformed
      hex traps **`22P02`** deterministically pre-scan; rendered `\x`+lowercase-hex. Unlike text
      there is no UTF-16 ordering trap (bytea is raw bytes). _(was: M; §4/§8; spec/design/types.md
      §13, encoding.md §2.6)_ **Deferred follow-ups:** bytea in a `PRIMARY KEY` / index (the
      order-preserving `bytea-terminated-escape` key encoding is authored in `encoding.md §2.6`
      but unexercised — bytea PK is rejected `0A000`); the traditional escape input format
      (`\nnn`); bytea⇄other casts; binary functions (`length`, `||`, `substring`,
      `encode`/`decode`, `get_byte`).
- [x] **`uuid`** — done & committed across Rust/Go/TS. A fixed **16-byte** value (RFC 4122),
      compared by **unsigned byte order** over the 16 bytes. Storage + comparison/ordering
      (`= < > <= >=`, `IS [NOT] DISTINCT FROM`); on-disk type code **8** with the engine's first
      **fixed-width non-integer** value codec (16 raw bytes, **no** length prefix), byte-exact
      across cores (golden `uuid_table.jed`). Another comparison-operator **overload**
      (`catalog.toml` carries `uuid`-family rows). A uuid literal is a single-quoted string that
      **adapts to a uuid context** (the §6 string-adaptation rule, like bytea), with
      **PostgreSQL-flexible input** replicating `uuid_in` (optional `{}`, any case, an optional
      hyphen after each whole byte-pair — canonical `8-4-4-4-12`, hyphen-less 32-hex, and the
      every-4-digit grouping all accepted; a misplaced hyphen is rejected), normalized to the
      canonical **lowercase** `8-4-4-4-12` on **output**; malformed input traps **`22P02`**
      pre-scan. Rendered under the `T` tag. **First non-integer `PRIMARY KEY`** — uuid lifts the
      key narrowing the other non-integer types defer: its `uuid-raw16` order-preserving key
      encoding (bare 16 bytes — no escape/terminator/sign-flip) is **exercised** (CREATE/INSERT/
      point-lookup/`ORDER BY`/duplicate-key over a uuid PK), proving the executor key path
      generalizes beyond integers. Authored spec-first: `spec/design/types.md §14`,
      `encoding.md §2.7` (+ uuid key vectors in `encoding/integers.toml`), `format.md` (type code
      8 + value codec), `catalog.toml` (+ codegen), capability `types.uuid`; pinned by
      `spec/conformance/suites/types/uuid.test` (51/0/0 byte-identical in Rust, Go, TS, with
      `# cost:` asserted) and the byte-exact golden `uuid_table.jed`. _(was: M; §4/§8;
      spec/design/types.md §14, encoding.md §2.7)_ **Deferred follow-ups:** uuid⇄other casts
      (`text ⇄ uuid`, `bytea ⇄ uuid` — rejected `0A000`/`42804`, a later cast slice); uuid
      functions (`gen_random_uuid()`, `uuid_generate_v*`).
- [ ] **`json` / `jsonb`** — optional headline feature (§1). Large surface. _(size: XL; §4)_
- [ ] **Composite `array` type** — a **container** over the scalar set: a new type *axis*,
      not another scalar (CLAUDE.md §4). Array literals, element-type rules, `NULL` element
      vs `NULL` array, equality/ordering, and an order-preserving key encoding for
      arrays-in-keys. Match PostgreSQL array semantics by default (§1). Large surface;
      sequence after the core scalar set settles. _(size: XL; §4/§8)_
- [ ] **Float policy decision.** §8 deliberately keeps `f64` out of compare/text-output
      paths. Decide if floats ever exist, and if so how rendered. _(size: S decision / L if built; §8)_

---

## Phase 4 — Relational depth + constraints

> The meaty planner/executor work and the rest of the integrity story.

- [x] **`JOIN` — multi-table FROM + `INNER`/`CROSS`** — done & committed across Rust/Go/TS. The
      `SELECT` FROM clause grew from a single table name to a **left-deep chain**
      (`from_clause ::= table_ref join_clause*`): **table aliases** (`t AS a` / `t a`), **qualified
      column references** (`t.col`, via a new `Dot` token), a **scope resolver** (an ordered list
      of `(label, table, column-offset)` that bakes a flat index into the existing `Column` node —
      so the joined row is each relation's row **concatenated** and the whole expression evaluator
      is untouched), and a **left-deep nested-loop** executor. Bare column ambiguous across
      relations → **`42702`** (`ambiguous_column`, new), unknown qualifier → `42P01`, self-join
      without distinct aliases → **`42712`** (`duplicate_alias`, new), non-boolean `ON` → `42804`.
      The `ON` is three-valued (a NULL join key never matches) and evaluated **at its join node**
      (not folded into WHERE), so outer joins are a clean executor-only follow-on. Cost is the
      cross-core contract ([cost.md §3](spec/design/cost.md)): `storage_row_read` per materialized
      row (Σ cardinalities), `operator_eval` per `ON` candidate combination, `row_produced` per
      emitted row. Authored in [grammar.ebnf](spec/grammar/grammar.ebnf) + [grammar.md §15](spec/design/grammar.md),
      capabilities `query.join_inner` / `query.cross_join` / `query.table_alias` /
      `query.qualified_column` + the `joins` profile in [manifest.toml](spec/conformance/manifest.toml),
      pinned by `spec/conformance/suites/joins/*.test`. _(was: L; deps: expression evaluator)_
  - [x] **Outer joins — `LEFT`/`RIGHT`/`FULL [OUTER] JOIN`** — done & committed across Rust/Go/TS.
        **Executor-only** follow-on as planned: the existing left-deep nested-loop gained an
        "unmatched row → NULL-extend the absent side" branch (LEFT/FULL preserve unmatched left rows,
        RIGHT/FULL preserve unmatched right rows), with NULL-pad widths taken from the **scope** (not a
        sampled row, so an empty intermediate result pads correctly). The three-valued `ON` is unchanged
        (a NULL key NULL-extends rather than drops), `WHERE` still runs post-join (the PG "WHERE on the
        nullable side downgrades to inner" behavior falls out for free), and cost matches the inner join
        except for the extra preserved rows — NULL-extension charges no `operator_eval`
        ([cost.md §3](spec/design/cost.md)). New capabilities `query.join_left` / `query.join_right` /
        `query.join_full` + the `outer_joins` profile in [manifest.toml](spec/conformance/manifest.toml),
        pinned by `spec/conformance/suites/joins/{left,right,full}.test`; semantics documented in
        [grammar.md §15](spec/design/grammar.md). `USING` / `NATURAL` / comma-`FROM` / `t.*` stay
        deferred. _(was: M; deps: INNER/CROSS slice)_
- [ ] **Subqueries** — scalar, `IN (subquery)`, `EXISTS`, then correlated. _(size: L; deps: joins)_
- [ ] **Set operations** — `UNION [ALL]`, `INTERSECT`, `EXCEPT`. _(size: M)_
- [x] **`NOT NULL`** — explicit column constraint; storing NULL (direct, omitted, or applied
      default) traps `23502`. PRIMARY KEY still implies it (spec/design/constraints.md §1).
- [x] **`DEFAULT`** (literal) — `DEFAULT <literal>` column constraint, evaluated + coerced once
      at CREATE TABLE; applied for an omitted column or the `DEFAULT` keyword; persisted via flags
      bit2 + the value codec. Landed with the **`INSERT` column list** + the `DEFAULT` value
      keyword (grammar.md §16, constraints.md §2). A general-expression default stays deferred.
- [ ] **Constraints (remaining)** — `UNIQUE`, `CHECK`, **composite `PRIMARY KEY`** (key encoding
      already composes — types.md §7), `FOREIGN KEY`. These are heavier. _(size: M→L each)_
- [ ] **Secondary indexes** (`CREATE INDEX`) — also a planner + storage concern (index
      pages, index maintenance on write). _(size: L; deps: storage maturation)_
- [ ] **`RETURNING`** clause; **`UPSERT` / `ON CONFLICT`**. _(size: M; deps: UNIQUE)_
- [ ] **Relax the UPDATE narrowings** — allow assigning a `PRIMARY KEY` column (currently
      `0A000`; means the storage key can change). Documented as relaxable (§11 step 6).
      _(size: M; deps: transactions for clean re-keying)_

---

## Phase 5 — Transactions & the §3 commit model

> The real concurrency story. Currently only **per-statement** atomicity exists (UPDATE's
> two-phase pass); the §3 single-writer staging buffer is still future. Couples tightly
> with Phase 6 (the staging buffer *is* the in-memory pending set the COW commit flushes).

- [ ] **In-memory staging area / pending write set** — accumulate a writer's changes off to
      the side, last-committed state continuously readable (§3). _(size: L; §3)_
- [ ] **`BEGIN` / `COMMIT` / `ROLLBACK`** — multi-statement transactions on top of the
      staging buffer. _(size: L; deps: staging area)_
- [ ] **Reader/writer concurrency semantics + tests** — readers never block except during
      the commit root-swap window; single writer (§3). Determinism in tests is delicate.
      _(size: L; §3)_

---

## Phase 6 — Storage maturation (§9)

> Can lag the feature work until write volume makes whole-image rewrites costly. The
> forward-compatible hooks (two meta slots, checksum, root pointer, write-ordering) are
> already in place.
>
> **TB-scale non-foreclosure (CLAUDE.md §9):** these items are also the path to a
> **larger-than-RAM file that does not fall over**. RAM-sized is the dominant case but not a
> hard limit — present work must not foreclose >>RAM operation (no full-residency assumption
> above the storage seam; no operator that requires its whole input/output in RAM).

- [ ] **Incremental copy-on-write commit** — replace the whole-image serialize with
      dirty-page-only writes + meta-page root swap (§9, storage.md §4). _(size: XL; deps: staging area)_
- [ ] **Free-list / page reclamation** — reuse pages the new root no longer references
      (not version GC; still not MVCC). _(size: L; deps: incremental commit)_
- [ ] **B-tree interior pages + slotted page layout** — current layout is a flat sorted
      record chain (storage.md §6). Needed for scale. _(size: XL; deps: incremental commit)_
- [ ] **Buffer pool / demand paging** — make the resident set a **bounded cache of pages**
      with eviction (not the whole file), so a file far larger than RAM is served by paging in
      on demand. The `page_read` cost unit must count **logical** page accesses so the cache
      stays invisible to deterministic cost (§13, cost.md). _(size: XL; deps: B-tree pages +
      incremental commit; §9/§13)_
- [ ] **Streaming + spill-to-disk operators** — bound blocking operators (`ORDER BY`, hash
      `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`/aggregate, `DISTINCT`) by a memory budget and **spill to disk** when
      exceeded (external merge sort, grace hash join), so a query over larger-than-RAM data
      never materializes its whole input/output in memory. Pull-based row iteration is the
      enabler. _(size: XL; deps: paged storage; §9/§13)_
- [ ] **Compression of large values (LZ4).** Transparently compress large
      `text`/`bytea`/`json` values at the storage layer — likely **LZ4** (fast, streaming,
      cross-language). Pairs with the overflow-page path (a value larger than one page
      currently trips the `0A000` oversized-item narrowing — types.md §11, format.md). The
      compression library is a **third-party dependency → gated on CLAUDE.md §14** (human
      confirmation; must preserve cross-core byte-identity). _(size: L; §9/§14)_
- [ ] **Crash-recovery hardening** — torn-meta fixtures exist; expand durability/recovery
      tests. WAL is deferred (COW + root-swap gives atomicity without one). _(size: M; §9)_

---

## Phase 7 — Embedding / host API surface

> The north star is an **embeddable library** (§1). The formal API + bind parameters have
> **landed** (`spec/design/api.md`); the browser/OPFS host remains. Parallelizable with most
> feature work.

- [x] **Formal public API** — ✅ **landed** (`spec/design/api.md`): `create`/`open` a database
      file, crash-safe explicit `commit` (temp + fsync + atomic rename + dir fsync) / `close`,
      `prepare` a statement, execute, iterate result rows via a `Rows` cursor, structured-error
      surface (+ class-58 host codes). Same shape across all three cores; back-compat
      `execute(db, sql)` kept. _(was: size L; §1)_
- [x] **Parameterized queries (`$1`)** end-to-end — ✅ **landed**: `$N` is lexed/parsed,
      context-typed at resolve (42P18 if indeterminate), bound two-phase before any scan, run
      through `prepare`/`execute`/`execute_params`. Per-impl surface — corpus stays literal-only
      (conformance.md §1.2); tested in-impl (`params` test per core). _(was: size M)_
- [ ] **Storage hosts** — Node `fs` host **built** (Phase 7, `impl/ts/src/file.ts`; Rust/Go use
      `std::fs`/`os` directly); build the **browser/OPFS** host (`FileSystemSyncAccessHandle`)
      and confirm native file-host parity (§9, storage.md §2). _(size: L; §9)_
- [ ] **Cost ceiling (`max_cost`) + deterministic abort** — the metering seam exists (cost.md
      §6, `Outcome` carries `cost`); the host API shape reserves an options object on
      `prepare`/`execute` for it. Wire it + register a resource-limit SQLSTATE. _(size: M; §13)_
- [ ] **(Open question, not scheduled)** low-level direct access API beneath SQL
      (`getValue("table", key)`) — keep the seam open, don't build yet (§9). _(size: —)_

---

## Phase 8 — Testing & tooling infrastructure (§7)

> Cross-cutting; raises the honesty/coverage ceiling. Some pairs with earlier phases.

- [ ] **Differential-testing harness** vs PostgreSQL/SQLite oracles to bootstrap corpus
      cheaply (§7). Gated on **user-initiated** reference provisioning (§12) — never
      auto-provision. Valuable as soon as `text`/`decimal` widen the surface. _(size: L; §7)_
- [ ] **SQLancer-style metamorphic / generative testing** — finds logic bugs by
      synthesizing queries with known-correct answers. Explicitly *later* (§7). _(size: L; §7)_
- [ ] **Result-type assertion directive** — assert a column's precise declared type
      (`int16` vs `int32`) beyond the `I`/`T`/`R` render tag (deferred, conformance.md §7).
      _(size: S; §7)_
- [ ] **Corpus growth** — keep adding `.test` coverage as each feature lands (ongoing).

---

## Phase 9 — Language reach: more supported languages (§2)

> **Goal here is best experience per language, not spec-hardening** — the differential core
> set (Rust + Go + TS) already does the honesty work (CLAUDE.md §2, spec/design/cores.md).
> Each language is **native or wrapped** per the best-experience rule (performance vs. clean
> integration). **Two pivots** decide it (spec/design/cores.md §2.1–§2.2): (1) host-function
> hotness — hot-path per-row favors native, coarse favors wrap; (2) parallelism — the §3
> immutable-snapshot read path is near-lock-free, so wrapping Rust hands every host
> Rayon-grade intra-query parallelism free (and dodges Swift's ARC-contention), while native
> is strong for C#/Java (GC-cheap sharing) and weak for Swift. Wrapping the safe Rust core is
> a **first-class** choice here, not an exception. Any native core still passes the full
> conformance contract (§7/§8); a wrap inherits it from Rust.

- [ ] **C#** core — **lean native** (value-type generics, `Span<T>`, NativeAOT → near-Rust
      speed *and* a clean pure-managed NuGet package; in-process host functions). Strongest
      native candidate. _(size: XL native / L wrap; §2)_
- [ ] **Swift** core — **lean wrap** (UniFFI + XCFramework over the safe Rust core: Rust
      speed, well-trodden Apple packaging, untrusted-query safety preserved §13). Go native
      only if hot-path per-row host functions make the FFI upcall tax dominant.
      _(size: L wrap / XL native; §2/§13)_
- [ ] **Java** core — **conflicted**: wrap for performance (pre-Valhalla boxing + JIT warmup
      hurt a native core), native for clean pure-JAR packaging + in-process host functions
      (no JNI/upcall tax). Decide at scheduling time; Valhalla shifts it toward native.
      _(size: XL native / L wrap; §2)_
- [ ] **Design the host-function API vectorized/batched** up front — the single decision
      that keeps wrapping viable for any of the above (amortizes the per-row FFI upcall).
      _(size: M; §2, cross-cutting)_

---

## Ordering rationale & open tensions (for iteration)

- **Why Phase 1 first:** two canonical spec dirs (`grammar/`, `functions/`) are still
  empty, and a general expression evaluator is the prerequisite for almost everything in
  Phases 2 & 4. Cheap to do, unblocks the most.
- **Why the type system (Phase 3) is its own phase, not earlier:** it's *the product*, but
  most type work depends on the expression/operator substrate from Phase 1, and `decimal`
  (XL) shouldn't gate the SQL-shape features in Phase 2.
- **Tensions to decide:**
  - `NOT NULL` / `DEFAULT` are fundamental and easy — **done** (landed with the `INSERT` column
    list + `DEFAULT` keyword; constraints.md). (Was: pull them into Phase 2?)
  - `JOIN`s are arguably core SQL — **done** for `INNER`/`CROSS` (Phase 4); outer joins +
    aggregates remain. (Was: promote `JOIN`s ahead of aggregates?)
  - Transactions (Phase 5) could move earlier if multi-statement atomicity is wanted
    before storage maturation; it's only placed here because it couples with Phase 6.
  - `text` vs `decimal` ordering within Phase 3 — `text` is the bigger immediate unlock
    (LIKE, string fns); `decimal` is the bigger headline.

## Maybes / distant ideas (keep the door open — do NOT schedule)

> Not backlog. Architectural doors to **leave open**, not walk through now. The §9 rule —

- **Alternative access paths beyond low-level direct reads.** §9 already keeps a sub-SQL
  `getValue("table", key)` seam open. Read that intent broadly: keep the architecture from
  foreclosing *entirely different* surfaces over the same storage + type core.
- **Other query languages.** SQL is clunky; the core (typed values, order-preserving keys,
  relational storage) need not be SQL-only. A graph query language, a document/dataframe
  surface, etc., could one day sit *beside* SQL over the same engine. Very distant — just
  don't design anything that makes it impossible.
- **Graph / vector workloads.** Growing toward graph traversal or vector-similarity search.
  §9 already flags alternative physical layouts as open (column-oriented, key-value); a
  vector index would be another. Speculative — noted so the seam stays open.
- **Encryption at rest (file-level).** Whole-file or per-page **encryption** is a door to
  keep open, not a scheduled feature (CLAUDE.md §9, storage.md §6). The block seam is the
  natural insertion point; crypto would come from a **vetted library, never hand-rolled**
  (§14). The only present requirement is that the on-disk format and storage seam not
  foreclose it (don't assume page bytes are plaintext-comparable on disk).
