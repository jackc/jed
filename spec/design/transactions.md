## 1. What this realizes, and the accident it corrects

CLAUDE.md §3 fixes the concurrency model: **at most one writer**; a writer accumulates all
its changes in a **private in-memory staging area** (the pending write set) while the last
committed state stays continuously readable; readers **never block** against an in-flight
writer; the only globally-exclusive moment is the **commit** itself, which publishes the
staged changes atomically. There is exactly **one committed version plus one writer's
pending set** — no version chains, no per-row timestamps, no vacuum.

**The accident this corrects.** The first host API fused two different things into one
`commit()` call: the **transaction boundary** (when changes become atomic and visible) and
**durability** (the `fsync`). Because durability was a whole-image rewrite (expensive), the
path of least resistance was "make the host call `commit` explicitly and rarely" — so the
*cost of durability dictated the transaction model*. That is backwards, and it produced two
surprises: no autocommit (every mutation needed a manual `commit` to persist), and a `close`
that silently discarded committed-looking work.

The correction is to **un-fuse the two concerns** (§9):

- **Transaction commit** = the snapshot swap (§2). Atomic, visible, cheap; happens at the end
  of *every* transaction, including an autocommit single-statement one.
- **Durability** = the `fsync`, governed by a `synchronous` setting (default **on**), orthogonal
  to the commit boundary.

Once un-fused, **autocommit is just the PostgreSQL default** (§4): each statement is its own
transaction that commits on success / rolls back on error, unless inside an explicit
`BEGIN … COMMIT`. This is what hosts expect (SQLite, MySQL, PG all autocommit by default) and
what CLAUDE.md §1 selects (the prior "no autocommit" was an undocumented divergence with no
overriding reason). The remaining job of this slice is to make the pending set **first-class,
rollback-able, and snapshot-isolated** — the three properties the always-mutate-live model
lacked.

## 2. The model: immutable snapshots + a working root

The committed state is an **immutable `Snapshot`**. A transaction is *a view of a `Snapshot`*
— a **read** transaction is a reference to a committed snapshot; a **write** transaction is a
*working* snapshot built from it that has not been swapped in yet. So the §3 "staging area,"
the "read snapshot," and the "pending write set" are **one structure**, not three.

```
Snapshot (immutable) = { txid, tables: PersistentMap<name → TableEntry> }
TableEntry           = { def, store: PersistentTree<key,Row>, next_rowid }

Database handle      = { committed: ref<Snapshot>,   # last committed, what fresh readers see
                         current_tx,                  # the open transaction, if any (§4)
                         write_lock,                  # held by the one write tx (§10)
                         live_snapshots,              # liveness registry (§8)
                         synchronous }                # durability mode (§9)

Transaction          = read:  { snapshot: ref<Snapshot> }                 # no write lock
                       write: { working: Snapshot, base_txid, … }          # holds write_lock
```

- A **write** transaction builds each statement's effect against `working` — the persistent
  structures (§3) copy only the touched paths, so producing the new `working` does **not**
  mutate `committed`. After the statement's two-phase validation (§6) the new root is adopted
  into `working`. Read-your-writes within the transaction falls out: a write is immediately
  visible to the next statement on the same transaction because that statement reads `working`.
- A **read** transaction holds a committed `Snapshot` by reference and never builds a working
  root — it cannot mutate (§4.3). Many may be open at once.
- **Commit** (of a write tx) publishes `working` — `committed := working`, **a single pointer
  swap** (the §3 short commit window) — makes it durable per the `synchronous` setting (§9),
  releases the write lock, and bumps `txid`. Committing a read tx is a no-op.
- **Rollback** drops the pending root (`working` discarded) and releases the write lock. For a
  read tx it just releases the snapshot.
- A `Rows` cursor captures its transaction's `Snapshot` and is thereby stable for its life and
  lock-free; the writer cannot disturb it because the writer never mutates a published snapshot
  in place.

This is the bbolt model (a read tx is a `View`, a write tx is an `Update` owning its own root;
commit swaps the meta root), here realized in memory first ([storage.md](storage.md) §4,
CLAUDE.md §12).

## 3. The persistent ordered map

The one new primitive. It replaces the current per-table store (a mutable
`BTreeMap`/hash-map-plus-sort) with a **persistent (immutable, structurally-shared) ordered
map** keyed by the encoded-key bytes (memcmp order — [encoding.md](encoding.md)). Required
operations: `get`, `insert→new`, `remove→new`, in-order `iter`, and `range` (for later).
Each mutation **path-copies** root→leaf and shares the untouched siblings, so the prior root
is provably unchanged and a snapshot is an O(1) reference clone.

**Recommended shape: a copy-on-write B-tree.** Chosen deliberately as the in-memory
precursor of the on-disk B-tree (Phase 6, [storage.md](storage.md) §6): when incremental
copy-on-write commit lands, it **page-backs the tree we already have** rather than building
one — which collapses the two separate Phase-6 XL items ("incremental COW commit" and
"B-tree interior pages") into one coherent slice ([TODO.md](../../TODO.md) Phase 6). *Decided:
B-tree, not a persistent BST* — a binary node never maps to a page, so a BST would still
force a re-pack at Phase 6; the B-tree avoids it. (A persistent BST remains the documented
fallback if the B-tree proves too costly to keep in lockstep across three cores; it preserves
every §2 guarantee and only forfeits the Phase-6 convergence.)

**Cross-core contract — widened at Phase 6.** Through Phase 5 only **iteration order**
(ascending encoded key) and the **serialized on-disk bytes** were contractual; the in-RAM node
structure (fan-out, split points) was a **private per-core detail**. **P6.1 closed that
freedom:** the in-memory copy-on-write B-tree *is* the on-disk B-tree (node ↔ page), so its
node layout and its **size-driven split/merge rules are now a §8 byte contract**, spec'd with
golden fixtures in [../fileformat/format.md](../fileformat/format.md). All four
implementations (Rust/Go/TS + the Ruby reference) run identical split (`payload > C` → 2-way
median-promote, split point `m = min(largest m with leftpayload ≤ C, N-2)`) and rebalance
(underfull `payload < C/2` → merge-then-maybe-split) rules over a `RECORD_MAX = (C-12)/2`
single-record cap, so the trees — and therefore the bytes — are identical. Fan-out is now
governed by **page fit**, not a tuning constant.

**In-memory reclamation is free.** An old `Snapshot` is reclaimed by the language's own
mechanism the instant nothing references it — `Arc` refcount in Rust, GC in Go/TS — so the
§3 "old version becomes free after commit" is automatic in memory. The explicit free-list
that replaces it for *pages* is Phase 6, and it leans on the §8 watermark.

### 4.1 Autocommit (the default)

Between explicit transactions the handle is in **autocommit** mode. Each statement runs in its
own implicit single-statement transaction:

- The engine **infers the access mode from the statement kind**: a read statement (`SELECT`, a
  read-only query expression / set operation) → a **read** transaction (a committed snapshot,
  no write lock); a write statement (`INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE`/`CREATE`/`DROP`/…) → a **write**
  transaction (a working root + the write lock).
- On **success** the implicit transaction **commits** — snapshot swap + durability per the
  `synchronous` setting (§9). On **error** it **rolls back** (the statement's two-phase pass
  already guarantees no partial write — §6); autocommit continues and subsequent statements run
  normally. This is PostgreSQL autocommit behavior, and because per-statement atomicity already
  matched it, **the conformance harness stays green** (each statement commits, the next sees it
  — read-your-writes across statements is preserved).

### 4.2 Explicit transaction blocks

`BEGIN [TRANSACTION] [READ ONLY | READ WRITE]` (also `START TRANSACTION …`; default access
mode **READ WRITE**) opens an explicit block; subsequent statements run within it until it
ends:

- **`COMMIT`** (`COMMIT [TRANSACTION|WORK]`, `END`) publishes + makes durable (§9) and returns
  to autocommit. Committing a **failed** block (§6) performs a `ROLLBACK` instead (PostgreSQL).
- **`ROLLBACK`** (`ROLLBACK [TRANSACTION|WORK]`) discards `working` and returns to autocommit;
  it also clears a **failed** block.
- **`BEGIN` while already in an explicit block** has no defined action (no nesting without
  `SAVEPOINT` — §11) → **`25001 active_sql_transaction`**.
- **`COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK` in autocommit mode** (no open block) → a **lenient no-op success**.
  PostgreSQL warns ("there is no transaction in progress"); jed has no warning channel
  (CLAUDE.md §4), so it silently succeeds rather than raising — a documented, deliberate
  divergence. (No `25P01` is raised.)

The asymmetry — `BEGIN`-in-block errors, `COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK`-with-no-block do not — is
principled: `COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK` always have a well-defined action (publish/discard the current
work), while a nested `BEGIN` does not. Error where the action is undefined; succeed where it
is defined.

### 4.3 Access modes: read-only vs read-write

The access mode is **load-bearing for concurrency** (§10): a **read** transaction takes **no
write lock**, so any number run concurrently with each other and with the one writer; a
**write** transaction takes the **exclusive write lock**. Because the lock cannot be acquired
lazily mid-transaction without upgrade/deadlock hazards, the mode is **fixed when the
transaction opens** — declared for explicit blocks, inferred for autocommit (§4.1):

- **READ WRITE** (the default) may read and write; it takes the write lock at `BEGIN` and holds
  it for the whole block (even across its read-only statements — a host wanting maximal read
  concurrency should use READ ONLY).
- **READ ONLY** may only read; it takes no write lock and pins **one committed snapshot across
  all its statements** (the reason a host opens one even under single-writer: a multi-statement
  *consistent* read — read a balance, then the matching ledger rows, against one snapshot). A
  write statement attempted in a READ ONLY transaction → **`25006 read_only_sql_transaction`**
  (PostgreSQL's code). A READ ONLY transaction needs no working root at all.

These long-lived read snapshots are exactly the **live readers** the §8 watermark tracks, so
this is also what makes Phase 6 page reclamation safe.

### 4.4 The host API surface (api.md)

The same model, programmatically (idiomatic per core — [api.md](api.md) §6):

- **`db.begin(writable) -> Transaction`** opens an explicit transaction; statements run on it
  (`tx.execute(…)`, `tx.query(…) -> Rows`); `tx.commit()` / `tx.rollback()` end it.
- **`db.view(fn)`** (read) and **`db.update(fn)`** (read-write) are closure wrappers
  (bbolt-style): open the transaction, run `fn(tx)`, **auto-commit on success / auto-rollback
  on error or panic** — the safe default that cannot forget to end the transaction.
- The **autocommit one-shots** `db.execute(sql)` / `db.query(sql)` wrap `begin → run → commit`
  with the inferred access mode (§4.1) — they are how the conformance harness and simple hosts
  drive the engine.
- The **SQL** `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK` drive the handle's implicit current transaction (for
  SQL-string-only hosts and the corpus); they and the API forms are two surfaces over one
  mechanism.

### 4.5 DDL is transactional

`CREATE TABLE` / `DROP TABLE` stage into `working` like any mutation and roll back with it
(PostgreSQL behavior). The atomic unit a commit publishes is **catalog + every table's rows +
the rowid counters** as one swappable `Snapshot` — which is also why Phase 6's incremental
commit must copy-on-write the catalog page chain, not only data pages.

## 5. Isolation & visibility

- **Snapshot isolation, per transaction.** Every transaction sees a stable snapshot for its
  life: a read transaction pins its committed snapshot across all its statements (§4.3); a write
  transaction reads its own `working` root (read-your-writes). With a single writer (§10) there
  are no write-write conflicts, so no serialization failures and no retry loop. We commit to
  snapshot isolation and **nothing weaker** — there is no `READ UNCOMMITTED` (a reader never
  sees another transaction's unpublished working set).
- **Autocommit reads see the latest committed state.** Each autocommit `SELECT` is its own read
  transaction, so consecutive autocommit reads may observe different committed states as the
  writer advances. A host that needs several reads against *one* state uses an explicit
  `READ ONLY` transaction (§4.3).
- **A `Rows` cursor is snapshot-stable for its life** — its rows cannot change mid-iteration
  even if a writer commits, because a published snapshot is never mutated in place.

## 6. Error & abort semantics

Statement-level atomicity is already two-phase / all-or-nothing (CLAUDE.md §11 step 6:
`INSERT`/`UPDATE` validate every row before writing any). Transaction-level abort composes on
top of it and **depends on the mode**, faithfully mirroring PostgreSQL:

- **Autocommit** (§4.1): a statement error rolls back **only that statement** (its two-phase
  pass guarantees it wrote nothing partial); autocommit continues and subsequent statements run
  normally. This is PostgreSQL autocommit error behavior and exactly today's behavior — so the
  corpus stays green.
- **Explicit block** (§4.2): a statement error **aborts the transaction** — it enters the
  **failed** state. Every subsequent statement except `ROLLBACK` (and `COMMIT`, treated as
  `ROLLBACK`) is rejected with **`25P02 in_failed_sql_transaction`** until the block ends.
  `ROLLBACK` clears the failed state. This matches PostgreSQL's "current transaction is aborted,
  commands ignored until end of transaction block."

New error codes (class 25, *invalid transaction state*), in
[../errors/registry.toml](../errors/registry.toml):

| code | name | raised when |
|---|---|---|
| `25001` | `active_sql_transaction` | `BEGIN` issued inside an explicit block (no nesting — §4.2) |
| `25006` | `read_only_sql_transaction` | a write statement issued in a READ ONLY transaction (§4.3) |
| `25P02` | `in_failed_sql_transaction` | any statement but `ROLLBACK`/`COMMIT` in a failed block (§6) |

A `COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK` with no open block is a no-op success, **not** an error — so `25P01` is
deliberately *not* registered (§4.2). These class-25 codes are a per-core SQL/API surface,
asserted by the shared corpus only via the deterministic `BEGIN/…/ROLLBACK` visibility tests
(§10).

## 7. The rowid counter and other transactional state

The no-PK synthetic rowid is a **monotonic counter** per table (`next_rowid`, reconstructed
on load as `max(key)+1` — [../fileformat/format.md](../fileformat/format.md)). Under staging
it is **part of the `Snapshot`** (per-`TableEntry`): pending `INSERT`s advance the `working`
copy, and a **rollback** discards those allocations along with the rows (the counter returns to
the committed value). Because the rowid is an **internal** key and never a user-visible
sequence, this is correct and simpler than PostgreSQL sequences (which deliberately *burn* a
value on rollback); jed has no such observable to preserve. Any future transactional counter
(e.g. an `IDENTITY`/sequence, if ever added) would have to decide burn-vs-restore explicitly;
the internal rowid restores.

## 8. The reader-liveness watermark (realized in the shared handle; forward hook for Phase 6)

Every `Snapshot` carries its `txid` (its **version**). The **oldest live version** is the
minimum version any still-open reader has pinned, or the committed version when no reader is
live. In Phase 5 this watermark does no work — memory reclamation is the language's job (§3). It
is built now because **Phase 6's page free-list needs it**: a page freed at commit `T` may be
reused only once `oldest_live_txid > T`, otherwise a still-open reader holding an older snapshot
would observe a recycled page. Tracking liveness now (where it is nearly free) is what keeps
Phase 6 reclamation safe without a retrofit — the single tightest coupling between the two phases.

**P6.2 consumes the watermark (the free-list gate).** Phase 6's page free-list
([../fileformat/format.md](../fileformat/format.md) *Reclamation*) is the consumer the watermark
was built for: a page freed at `txid T` may be reused only once `oldest_live_txid > T`, else a
still-open reader on an older snapshot would observe a recycled page. P6.2's first form
**reconstructs the free-list on open** (the file's dead pages = `[2, page_count)` minus the
committed root's reachable set) and reuses them during the session; every such page was already
dead at the opened committed version, and a single file-backed handle has
`oldest_live_txid == committed.txid`, so the gate holds **trivially**. It becomes load-bearing in
the deferred follow-on — *continuous* within-session reclamation paired with file-backed reader
sharing — where a just-orphaned page (last referenced by version `T`) must stay out of the
free-list until `oldest_live_txid > T`.

**P5.3b realizes the watermark in the shared handle (§10).** A single-handle `Database` has only
one live snapshot at a time (`committed`, or an open tx's `working`), so its `oldest_live_txid`
is trivially the committed version. The interesting case is the **shared handle**: it owns a
**live-reader registry** — a multiset of pinned versions (`version → refcount`, several readers
may pin the same version). A read handle, on open, pins the committed snapshot and registers its
version; on close/drop it deregisters. `oldest_live_txid` is the registry's minimum, or the
committed version when the registry is empty. The minimum is order-independent, so no hash-map
iteration order leaks into it (CLAUDE.md §8). This is the exact structure Phase 6's free-list
will consult before reusing a page; the per-core tests already assert it tracks pinned readers
(a reader pinning an old version holds the watermark back; closing it lets the watermark advance).

## 9. Durability: the `synchronous` setting, this slice vs. Phase 6

Commit (the snapshot swap, §2) and durability (the `fsync`) are **separate** (§1). A
database-level **`synchronous`** setting governs *when* the fsync fires relative to the commit:

- **`on` (default)** — a commit makes its changes durable **before it returns**: the existing
  crash-safe recipe ([api.md](api.md) §3 — temp file + `fsync` + atomic `rename` + dir `fsync`
  in the whole-image era; dirty-page write + meta-slot publish + `fsync` in Phase 6). Safe; the
  per-statement cost under autocommit is the familiar SQLite/PG `synchronous_commit = on` cost,
  and the escape hatch is an explicit `BEGIN … COMMIT` (one fsync for many statements).
- **`off` / relaxed** — a commit is **visible in memory immediately** but the fsync is
  **batched / deferred** (e.g. on a checkpoint, on `close`, or by a background flush). Faster;
  a crash may lose the **last few committed transactions** but **never corrupts**, because the
  on-disk image is always a valid *older* snapshot (the root is published atomically — §2,
  [storage.md](storage.md) §4). This is the standard `PRAGMA synchronous=OFF` /
  `synchronous_commit=off` trade.

**The seam, default `on`.** The fsync is the single chokepoint at the commit boundary; `off`
(batching/group-commit) is an additive change behind it and can land later. **Phase 5** kept
durability whole-image (the §3 recipe behind the §2 block seam); **P6.1** changed the
materialization to incremental copy-on-write — write the dirty pages the new root introduced +
the rewritten catalog, `sync`, publish the alternate meta slot, `sync` — under a **frozen**
transaction API, making the per-commit fsync write `O(dirty path)` pages instead of the whole
image ([../fileformat/format.md](../fileformat/format.md), *Allocation & incremental commit*).
The `synchronous` setting is orthogonal to both. (This refines CLAUDE.md §9's "writes … land
durably on the SSD at commit": durably at commit under `synchronous=on`, batched under `off`.)

## 10. Concurrency mechanism & the testing split

- **Single writer, lock-free readers.** A read transaction takes **no** lock and never blocks —
  not even during another transaction's commit swap, since it holds its own snapshot and does
  not observe the pointer change (CLAUDE.md §3's "readers block only during commit" is the
  conservative statement; the immutable-snapshot model does better). A read-write transaction
  takes the **exclusive write lock** at `begin`/`BEGIN` and holds it until commit/rollback, so
  at most one writer exists at a time (§3). Concurrency between cores' hosts is the host's
  problem (CLAUDE.md §3), now mediated by snapshots + this one lock.

- **The shared handle (P5.3b) makes that real, not just describable.** The single-handle
  `Database` is fast and simple but **not safe to share across threads**: its reads borrow the
  handle while a write mutates it, so one handle cannot serve a reader thread and a writer thread
  at once. Real parallelism — readers running *concurrently with* an in-flight writer — needs the
  committed state behind a **thread-safe cell decoupled from any one thread's handle**. So each
  core adds a **shared handle** with exactly the §3 shape:
  - a **committed cell** holding the published snapshot — a reader pins it with a single cheap
    read (an `Arc` clone under a momentary read lock in Rust; a lock-free `atomic.Pointer` load in
    Go), a writer publishes a new one with a single swap (the §3 short commit window);
  - a **single-writer gate** — a writer **blocks** until the prior writer ends (a `Mutex`/condvar
    in Rust, a held `sync.Mutex` in Go), so at most one writer is ever open;
  - the **live-reader registry** of §8.
  A read handle pins the committed snapshot, registers its version, serves reads from that
  immutable snapshot (a write through it is `25006`), and deregisters on drop/close. A write
  handle captures the committed snapshot as a private working set (a `Database` with an open READ
  WRITE block) and, on commit, publishes it at the next version. Isolation is free from the
  persistent stores (§3): a pinned snapshot shares structure with later versions and is never
  mutated, so pinning is a pointer copy, not a deep copy.

- **Per-core reality differs, and that is expected (CLAUDE.md §2 — best experience per language,
  not uniform parallelism).** Rust and Go get **true OS-thread parallelism**: reader threads run
  on cores while a writer commits. The TS core has **no shared-memory threads for live objects**,
  so it offers the *other* half of the model — snapshot **isolation** across async interleavings
  (a pinned reader sees one stable version even as a writer commits between its calls) — via the
  same machinery, minus the parallelism (and a second open writer is **rejected** rather than
  blocked, since JS cannot block its one thread). This slice's shared handle is **in-memory**;
  file-backed sharing reuses the same publish point plus the §9 persist chokepoint and is wired
  when it lands (the concurrency mechanism and durability are orthogonal axes).

- **Testing splits along the determinism line:**
  - **Logical transaction semantics → the shared conformance corpus.** A
    `BEGIN / INSERT / ROLLBACK / SELECT-shows-nothing` sequence, abort-poisoning (`25P02`), a
    read-only-violation (`25006`), and visibility are all deterministic and single-handle, so
    they are ordinary corpus entries (a `transactions` profile + `txn.*` capabilities in
    [../conformance/manifest.toml](../conformance/manifest.toml)).
  - **The concurrency mechanism → per-core tests.** "A reader does not block during a concurrent
    commit," "the writer is exclusive," "a reader pinned before a commit still yields the
    pre-commit rows," and "the watermark tracks pinned readers" depend on scheduling (Rust/Go) or
    interleaving (TS) and are **not** cross-core deterministic, so they live in each core's own
    test suite — Rust/Go fan out real threads (Go under `-race`), TS asserts isolation across
    interleaved calls — exactly as the `$N` bind parameters are tested per-core, not in the
    corpus ([conformance.md](conformance.md) §1.2).

## 11. Deferred / explicitly not foreclosed

- **`SAVEPOINT` / nested transactions** — deferred. The structure anticipates them: `working`
  becomes a **stack** of snapshots (a `SAVEPOINT` pushes, `ROLLBACK TO` pops to a marked root).
  Until then a nested `BEGIN` is `25001` (§4.2). Not built; not foreclosed.
- **Lazy write-lock acquisition** — a READ WRITE transaction takes the write lock at `begin`
  (bbolt's model), holding it across any read-only prologue. Deferring acquisition until the
  first write (more read concurrency) is a future optimization; not foreclosed, but it carries
  upgrade/deadlock hazards a single up-front grab avoids.
- **Group-commit / async durability** — the `synchronous=off` batching machinery beyond the
  seam (background flusher, fsync coalescing across concurrent committers) is deferred (§9). The
  seam is built; the policy is not.
- **MVCC / multiple concurrent committed versions** — explicitly **not** this (CLAUDE.md §3):
  one committed version plus one working set, period.
- **Isolation levels other than snapshot** — no `SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL`; snapshot
  isolation is the single level (§5). `READ UNCOMMITTED` is impossible by construction.
- **Two-phase commit / distributed transactions** — out of scope (single embedded file).
