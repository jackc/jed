# Cost accounting — design

A first-class use case is **safely evaluating untrusted, user-supplied queries**
(CLAUDE.md §13). That requires the engine to **deterministically meter the cost of
executing a query** and to **abort when a caller-supplied ceiling is reached**. Both halves
have landed: the metering **seam** — the cost counter threaded through the executor,
expression evaluator, and storage reads — and the **ceiling + deterministic abort** built on
it (§6). A caller sets `max_cost` on the handle (spec/design/api.md §8); the instant a
statement's accrued cost reaches it, execution aborts with `54P01` (`cost_limit_exceeded`).

## 1. Why cost is a shared contract, not an implementation detail

Because there is no reference implementation (CLAUDE.md §2), the only thing that says two
cores agree is that they produce identical results on the same shared tests. Cost is no
different: the cost of a given `(query, database state)` is **fully deterministic** and
**byte-identical across every core**. This makes it a CLAUDE.md §8 divergence hotspot,
and so it is **asserted in the conformance corpus** (the `# cost:` directive —
[conformance.md](conformance.md)), not merely in per-core tests. A divergence in any
core's counting is a failing corpus entry the day it appears.

## 2. The unit schedule is data

The cost units and their weights live in [../cost/schedule.toml](../cost/schedule.toml)
(data over code, CLAUDE.md §5), emitted into each core as `@generated` constants by
[../../scripts/gen_costs.rb](../../scripts/gen_costs.rb) — the same codegen "middle path"
as the operator catalog ([codegen.md](codegen.md)). The accrual **sites** (which line in
the executor/evaluator/storage fires which unit) are hand-written per core; §5 forbids
codegenning the evaluator. Only the **weights** are shared data.

The core seam units, all weight `1`:

| unit | fires when |
|---|---|
| `storage_row_read` | one row is read from a table store during a scan |
| `page_read` | one B-tree node (page) is touched while scanning a store |
| `row_produced` | one row is emitted into a query result set |
| `operator_eval` | one interior expression node is evaluated |

(`page_read` was **added** in P6.3 when the store became a page-backed B-tree — §3
"`page_read`" — *alongside* `storage_row_read`, not a rename; the later
`aggregate_accumulate` unit, [../cost/schedule.toml](../cost/schedule.toml), is metered in
the aggregates path, the `value_compress`/`value_decompress` units — §3 "the compression
units" — in the large-value codec paths, and the `decimal_work` unit — §3 "`decimal_work`"
— in the decimal arithmetic/comparison evaluations.) The weights are uniform on purpose — phase 1 proves the seam reads
cost from **data**; tuning the numbers later is a data-only change touching no executor code.

## 3. Accrual rules (the cross-core determinism contract)

These rules are the contract. They must be implemented **identically** in Rust, Go, and
TS; any deviation diverges the count and fails the corpus.

- **`storage_row_read`** is charged once per row pulled from a store, at the top of the
  executor scan loop, **before** the filter runs — in `SELECT`, `DELETE`, and `UPDATE`.
  It is charged in the **executor loop, not inside the storage iterator**: the Rust store
  returns a lazy iterator while Go/TS materialize a sorted slice, so charging in storage
  would diverge the (future) abort *point*. The executor loop is the one place all three
  cores agree.
- **`page_read`** is charged once per B-tree node (page) in a table's store when that store
  is scanned, as a block **before** that table's `storage_row_read`s — the dedicated
  subsection below gives the rule (a full scan touches every node, so the charge is the
  tree's structural node count).
- **`row_produced`** is charged once per row that survives the filter and is projected
  into a `SELECT` result set, at projection time (post-filter, post-`ORDER BY`, **and
  post-`LIMIT`/`OFFSET`**). `LIMIT`/`OFFSET` slice the sorted rows *before* the projection
  loop, so a row skipped by `OFFSET` or excluded by `LIMIT` charges **no** `row_produced`
  or projection cost — only the windowed rows do. Whether such an excluded row still pays
  `storage_row_read` + its filter `operator_eval`s depends on the plan: with a blocking
  operator (an `ORDER BY`, `DISTINCT`, aggregate, or join) the scan must read every row
  first, so it does; without one, the **LIMIT short-circuit** (subsection below) stops the
  scan once the window is filled, so it does **not**. `DELETE` / `UPDATE` emit no rows and so
  charge no `row_produced`.
- **`operator_eval`** is charged once per **interior** expression node — `cast`, `neg`,
  `not`, `arith`, `compare`, `and`, `or`, `is_null`, `distinct`. **Leaf nodes — `column`
  and the constants (`int`/`bool`/`null`) — charge nothing.** Charging leaves would make
  cost track how many literals the parser happened to fold, an accidental property; cost
  must track genuine evaluation work. A **decimal** arithmetic/comparison node additionally
  charges size-scaled `decimal_work` — the dedicated subsection below.
- **No short-circuit.** Both operands of every binary node (`and`, `or`, `compare`,
  `arith`, `distinct`) are **always** evaluated before the node charges its own
  `operator_eval`. This is already true — the Kleene helpers (`and3`/`or3`/`boolAnd`)
  are pure functions over already-computed operand values, never control flow. The seam
  **must not introduce** a short-circuit: skipping the RHS in one core when the LHS is
  FALSE/NULL would drop that core's operand evals and diverge the count.
- **`CASE` is the one deliberate exception to no-short-circuit.** A `CASE`
  ([grammar.md](grammar.md) §23) charges its own `operator_eval` for the node, then evaluates
  its `WHEN` conditions **in source order, stopping at the first one that is TRUE** — a FALSE
  or NULL/UNKNOWN condition falls through. Only the conditions tested **up to and including the
  match**, plus the **selected** result (the matching `THEN`, or the `ELSE`, or nothing for an
  implicit `ELSE NULL`), are evaluated and charged; later arms are **not** evaluated. This
  short-circuit is *required* by PostgreSQL semantics — `CASE WHEN a = 0 THEN 0 ELSE 1 / a END`
  must not divide by zero on the `a = 0` rows — so it is a sanctioned exception, not a seam
  violation. It stays deterministic per `(query, db state)` because the evaluation order (first
  match wins, conditions left to right) is fixed across cores, so which arms accrue is itself
  deterministic. (A consequence, like `DISTINCT`'s, is observable: `CASE WHEN true THEN 0 ELSE
  1/0 END` succeeds and costs *less* than the eager form would, because the `1/0` arm is never
  reached. The simple form `CASE x WHEN v …` desugars each branch to `x = v`, so the operand is
  evaluated once per tested branch — the same per-branch model as `IN`'s LHS.)
- **Pre-order, LHS-before-RHS.** A node charges itself, then evaluates its left operand,
  then its right. The order does not change the **total** (a sum is order-independent),
  but it fixes the deterministic **abort point** for the cost ceiling (§6) identically
  across cores.
- **Helpers are not separately charged.** `eval_arith`/`evalArith`, and the `<=`/`>=`
  comparisons' internal `lt3 OR eq3` combinators, are covered by their owning node's
  single `operator_eval`. They are not `RExpr` nodes.

### `page_read` — the pages a scan touches

The store is a **page-backed copy-on-write B-tree** (P6.1, [storage.md](storage.md) §6): each
table's rows live in a tree of fixed-size pages, and the node boundaries are a §8 byte contract
— *the same tree shape in every core* (the in-memory B-tree **is** the on-disk one, node-for-page).
So the number of pages a scan touches is **deterministic and byte-identical across cores**,
exactly the property cost requires.

- **A full table scan walks the whole tree**, so it charges `page_read` once per **node**
  (interior *and* leaf) in that table's tree — its structural **node count**. A scan with no
  usable primary-key bound (a predicate on a non-key column, an OR, or no WHERE) reads the entire
  store (the same loop that charges `storage_row_read` per row), so it touches every page. An
  **empty table** (no root) has zero nodes and charges no `page_read`. A scan whose WHERE bounds
  the primary key touches **fewer** pages — see "bounded scan / point lookup" below.
- **`page_read` is charged as a block, before that table's `storage_row_read`s** — read the
  pages, then the rows within them. Charged at the **same three sites** as `storage_row_read`
  (the `SELECT`/JOIN materialization, the `DELETE` scan, the `UPDATE` phase-1 scan), once per
  table-scan *execution*. The total is order-independent, but fixing the block-before-rows order
  pins the cost-ceiling abort point (§6) identically across cores.
- **It composes exactly like `storage_row_read`.** A **JOIN** materializes each base table
  once, so it charges each table's node count once (Σ over the relations — a self-join counts
  the table twice, once per alias). A **set operation** charges each operand's scans
  (`lhs + rhs`). An **uncorrelated** subquery (folded once) charges its tree once; a
  **correlated** subquery re-scans its inner table **per outer row**, charging that node count
  each time — identical to how those forms already compose `storage_row_read`.
- **Logical, not physical.** `page_read` counts the tree's structural node count — a *logical*
  page access — **not** a physical disk fetch. A future buffer pool / demand-paging cache for
  larger-than-RAM files (CLAUDE.md §9) serves a page from memory or disk transparently; the
  cost is identical either way, so the deterministic cost stays cache-independent (§13).
- **Overflow chains count too — for the columns the query references**
  ([large-values.md](large-values.md) §8.1/§12/§14). A record whose values spilled out-of-line
  stores them on a chain of overflow pages (`page_type 4`), and materializing such a value reads
  its chain — so the scan's `page_read` block also counts **one per overflow chain page of every
  record the scan's bound admits, for every spilled column in the query's *touched set*** (the
  full table when unbounded; the in-range records for a bounded scan, so a point lookup pays only
  *its* record's chains and a miss pays none — and a query that never references the spilled
  column pays nothing for it, however many records it admits). The touched set is **static**
  (below), so the charge stays an up-front block that does **not** short-circuit under `LIMIT`
  (see "LIMIT short-circuit"; tightening to the rows actually emitted is a possible later
  refinement, exactly like the leaves-actually-faulted note there). The chain page count is
  `ceil(stored / C)` per externalized value, where `stored` is the bytes the chain actually
  carries — the content payload for an external-plain value, the **compressed** block for an
  external-compressed one (large-values.md §13) — a function of the §8-contracted disposition
  rule and chain layout, so it is byte-identical across cores; a fully-inline table charges
  exactly the structural node count as before (existing costs do not move). The charge stays
  *logical* (§13): it models the lazy read-on-touch executor (large-values.md §7/§14) whether or
  not the engine physically reads eagerly today, the same way `page_read` predates the buffer
  pool.

### The touched set — which columns a scan "reads"

The **touched set** of a relation is the set of its columns the query **statically references**,
collected at plan time from the resolved expression trees (a §8 contract — every core collects
identically): the WHERE filter, every JOIN `ON`, and — for a non-aggregate query — the
projections and `ORDER BY` keys, or — for an aggregate query — the `GROUP BY` keys and every
aggregate's argument (an aggregate query's projections / `HAVING` / `ORDER BY` reference the
synthetic group row, whose inputs those keys and arguments already are). A **correlated
subquery's outer reference** into the relation counts (collected depth-aware through nested
plans). The set is per `(query, relation)` and purely syntactic: a column referenced only in a
never-taken `CASE` branch is still touched. Consequences worth naming:

- `SELECT small_col FROM t WHERE pk = $1` touches neither a spilled `body` column's chain nor a
  compressed value's slabs — the large-values headline case (large-values.md §7).
- `SELECT count(*) FROM t` and `EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM t …)` touch **no** columns of `t`: they
  charge the structural node block and row reads only.
- **`DELETE`** touches only its filter's columns — dropping a row never reads its chains.
- **`UPDATE`** touches its filter's columns plus every assignment **source**'s columns. The
  rewrite itself does not *read* an untouched stored value (under the §14 model an unchanged
  spilled value's bytes move without decompression); the write side stays metered by
  `value_compress` per stored row version, unchanged.

### `value_compress` / `value_decompress` — the compression units

Transparent LZ4 compression (large-values.md Slice B, [../fileformat/lz4.md](../fileformat/lz4.md))
is real CPU work in both directions, metered by two units so the §6 ceiling can bound it. Both are
quantized in **`C`-byte slabs of the *decompressed* (raw) payload** — `ceil(raw_len / C)` with
`C = page_size − 12`, the same slab size the overflow chains use — proportional to the work yet
computable from the stored lengths alone, so the charge never requires re-running the codec.

- **`value_decompress`** joins the scan's **up-front block** next to the chain `page_read`s: for
  every record the scan's bound admits, each **compressed** stored value (inline-compressed `0x03`
  or external-compressed `0x04`) **in a touched column** (the touched set above) charges
  `ceil(raw_len / C)`. The same composition rules apply verbatim — per JOIN base table, per
  correlated re-scan, no `LIMIT` short-circuit, nothing for a missed bound, nothing for an
  untouched column, and a table with no compressed value charges nothing.
- **`value_compress`** is the write side: an `INSERT`/`UPDATE` whose record exceeds `RECORD_MAX`
  runs the disposition decision's compress pass, and **every attempt** (adopted or rejected by
  *store-smaller* — the encoder ran either way) charges `ceil(raw_len / C)`. Charged once per
  stored row version at the statement's write site, never for the B-tree's internal re-encodes.
  A record that fits inline-plain attempts nothing, so existing costs do not move.

### `decimal_work` — size-scaled decimal arithmetic

A decimal value can now reach PostgreSQL's format caps — 131072 integer + 16383 fractional
digits ([decimal.md](decimal.md) §2) — so a single multiplication can be ~10⁹ limb operations.
A flat `operator_eval` would let an untrusted query buy that CPU for one unit (§1, CLAUDE.md
§13), so decimal arithmetic and comparison evaluations charge an **additional**
`decimal_work × (W − 1)`, where **W is the operation's work in base-10⁴ digit groups** — the
on-disk digit unit ([format.md](../fileformat/format.md)), deliberately **not** a core's
internal limb base (Rust/Go use base-10⁹, TS base-10⁴; the group count is computed from the
logical digit counts, identical everywhere).

Definitions, with each operand taken **after** `int → decimal` promotion: `d` = significant
digits of the coefficient (`0` for zero), `s` = display scale, and `q(n) = max(1, ceil(n/4))`.
For the scale-aligning operations let `s* = max(s1, s2)` and `aᵢ = dᵢ + (s* − sᵢ)` (the digit
count after the lower-scale coefficient is multiplied up). Then:

| operation | W |
|---|---|
| compare (`=` `<>` `<` `<=` `>` `>=`, `IS [NOT] DISTINCT FROM`, one `IN`-list element) | `max(q(a1), q(a2))` |
| `+` `−` | `max(q(a1), q(a2))` |
| `*` | `q(d1) · q(d2)` |
| `/` | `q(d1 + E) · q(d2)` with `E = rscale + s2 − s1` (`rscale` per `select_div_scale`, decimal.md §4) |
| `%` | `q(a1) · q(a2)` |
| `SUM`/`AVG` fold | the `+` formula, accumulator vs. input |

The rules:

- **Charged before the work runs, and immediately guarded.** The W − 1 units accrue *before*
  the limb loop executes, and the charge is **immediately followed by a §6 ceiling guard** —
  a new enforcement point alongside the per-node/per-row/per-fold guards — so a ceiling
  aborts ahead of the expensive operation, not after it. The abort point stays deterministic
  (the charge+guard is a single block at the owning node, after the node's `operator_eval`
  and its operand evaluations, mirrored identically across cores).
- **W − 1, not W.** The first group rides the operation's flat `operator_eval`. Operands of
  ≤ 4 aligned digits — every int-promoted small constant, money, ordinary literals — have
  W = 1 and charge **nothing**, so costs predating this unit are unchanged.
- **A NULL operand charges nothing** (the operation short-circuits to NULL before any limb
  work — same as its result rule). A **zero divisor/modulus charges nothing** and traps
  `22012` (the trap precedes the work). A zero **dividend** still charges by the formula
  (uniform, no special case; `d = 0` keeps it small).
- **Comparison nodes charge once**, even where a core's `<=`/`>=` decomposes into
  `lt3 OR eq3` internally (the "helpers are not separately charged" rule above).
- **Aggregate folds**: each `SUM`/`AVG` accumulate over decimals charges the `+` formula
  against the running accumulator (deterministic — rows fold in scan order, which is key
  order). `MIN`/`MAX` folds are direct `Value` compares like the sort's, and stay unmetered
  (the boundary below).
- **Linear single-pass work stays flat**: unary `−` / `abs`, casts and `round`/typmod
  rescale, literal parse, rendering, and the key-canonicalization in GROUP BY/DISTINCT are
  all O(digits) one-pass over a value the scan already paid for (`page_read` chains +
  `value_decompress`), with no quadratic blow-up — they keep their single flat charge (or
  none, where they were already unmetered). The quadratic operations are the attack
  surface; they are what scales.

### Bounded scan / point lookup — the pages a primary-key predicate touches

A **single-table** WHERE on the **primary key** does not need the whole tree. Because the key
encoding is **order-preserving** ([encoding.md](encoding.md) — raw byte order *is* value order),
a primary-key comparison maps to a contiguous range of storage keys, and the scan visits only the
B-tree nodes that range can intersect. This is the engine's first index-style access path; it is a
deliberate, cost-visible optimization, gated by the `query.point_lookup` capability.

- **Which predicates bound.** Flatten the WHERE's top-level **AND-chain** (an `OR` is never
  descended — a disjunction is not one contiguous range) and collect every conjunct of the form
  `pk <cmp> const-source` (`=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`; the primary key on either side; `BETWEEN`
  desugars to `pk >= a AND pk <= b`, so it falls out for free). The `const-source` must be of the
  **primary key's own type** — a promoted comparison (e.g. `intpk = 2.5`) does **not** bound — and
  is one of: a **literal**, a **bind parameter** `$N`, or (the correlated case below) a bare
  **enclosing-query column**. Every other conjunct stays in the **residual filter** (the whole
  WHERE, re-applied to each scanned row), so the bound is always a *superset* of the matching rows
  and the result is unchanged. A no-PK relation is **not** bounded (it keeps the full-scan cost
  above). In a **JOIN** each base table is bounded *independently* by the WHERE conjuncts on **its
  own** primary key against such a const-source (`query.join_pushdown`, "/ JOIN" below); a
  cross-relation `b.pk = a.x` is **not** bounded (a follow-on — see "/ JOIN").
- **`page_read` = the nodes the bound's key range intersects.** A scan visits the root, then
  descends only into a child subtree whose separator span can overlap the range — so a **point
  lookup** (`pk = c`) charges the root→leaf path (the tree height), and a **range** charges the
  path plus the contiguous run of leaves the range spans. The unbounded range (`−∞..+∞`, the full
  scan) intersects every node, so it reduces to the node count above — **existing full-scan costs
  do not move.** The overlap is computed from the resident interior separators **without faulting**
  a leaf, so it stays a *logical* count (the buffer-pool-invisible property holds). It is
  byte-identical across cores because the tree shape and the descent rule are both a §8 contract.
- **`storage_row_read` = the rows in range.** Only the rows whose key lies within the bound are
  read and charged (and then filtered) — a point lookup reads 0 or 1 row, not the whole table.
  The residual filter's `operator_eval`s therefore accrue only over the in-range rows.
- **A provably empty range charges nothing.** A `pk = NULL` (3VL-unknown) or contradictory bounds
  (`pk > 5 AND pk < 5`) admit no key, so the scan reads no page and no row — `page_read` 0,
  `storage_row_read` 0, and a mutation deletes/updates nothing. (A point-lookup *miss* on an
  existing key range — `pk = 99` where 99 isn't stored — still visits the leaf it would live in,
  so it charges that path's `page_read` but reads no row.)

`spec/conformance/suites/query/point_lookup.test` pins these costs cross-core; the bounded forms in
`expr/cost.test`, `query/distinct.test`, `query/limit_offset.test`, and `query/select_list.test`
exercise them in context.

**Bounded scan / JOIN — each base table bounded by its own PK predicate.** In a multi-table FROM
each base table is materialized independently (see "JOIN" below), so each is bounded **on its own**
by the WHERE conjuncts on **its** primary key against a const-source — exactly the per-relation form
of the rule above. `SELECT … FROM a JOIN b … WHERE a.pk = 5` materializes a's matching row (a seek)
and full-scans b; `WHERE a.pk = 5 AND b.pk = 10` seeks both. A point-lookup **miss** on a join key
(`a.pk = 999`) materializes **zero** rows for that table, so the nested loop has nothing to drive —
the join collapses to the other tables' scan cost. The bound's source is still a constant
(literal/param/outer); a **cross-relation** `b.pk = a.x` is **not** bounded — binding b's key to a's
value per outer row is the index-nested-loop case, a follow-on (a sibling column is not a
const-source). Bounds come only from the **WHERE**, never an `ON` (an ON failure NULL-extends rather
than drops, so it is not a post-join filter). **Sound for outer joins:** a non-NULL PK conjunct in
WHERE is unknown for a NULL-extended row, so it discards every NULL-extension of that relation — the
LEFT/RIGHT/FULL join degenerates to INNER on the bounded side, and any surviving output row has that
PK in range, so bounding the table cannot drop it. Gated by `query.join_pushdown`, pinned cross-core
in `spec/conformance/suites/joins/pushdown.test`.

**Bounded scan / correlated — the inner PK bound from an outer column.** A correlated subquery is
re-executed once per outer row (see "Subqueries" below). When its inner query is a **single table**
whose WHERE compares the inner **primary key** to an **enclosing-query column** — `inner.pk = o.col`
(or `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`) — the bound's `const-source` is that outer column, resolved to **the
current outer row's value** each time the inner runs. So the inner **seeks** (a per-outer-row point
lookup/range) instead of re-scanning the whole inner table for every outer row: across N outer rows
the inner's `storage_row_read` drops from `N × |inner|` to `N ×` (rows in range, 0/1 for a point
lookup), and `page_read` from `N × node_count` to `N ×` the access-path nodes. It is the **same
bounded-scan mechanism** — the only addition is that the source is read from the outer row rather
than a literal/param — so soundness is identical (the whole WHERE stays the residual filter) and the
**rows are unchanged**; only the inner re-scan cost drops. The bound is still fully deterministic per
`(query, db)`: the outer rows are deterministic, so each per-outer-row bound — and its cost — is too,
and it is byte-identical across cores (the outer value, the key codec, and the overlap rule are all
shared). A NULL outer value gives a 3VL-empty bound (the inner reads nothing). This is gated by the
`query.correlated_pushdown` capability and pinned cross-core in
`spec/conformance/suites/subquery/correlated_pushdown.test`. JOIN base tables and no-PK inners stay
unbounded (the same follow-on as above).

### LIMIT short-circuit — stopping the scan when the window is filled

A `LIMIT` normally windows *after* the scan, so every scanned row pays `storage_row_read` even when
the window excludes it (above). But when the query is a **single table with no blocking operator** —
no join, aggregate, `DISTINCT`, or `ORDER BY` — there is nothing that needs to see all the rows, so
the engine **streams** scan→filter→project and **stops the scan the instant the `LIMIT`/`OFFSET`
window is filled.** This is the engine's first early-out, gated by the `query.limit_short_circuit`
capability.

- **`storage_row_read` counts only the rows actually read.** The scan reads in primary-key order,
  skipping `OFFSET` passing rows and producing `LIMIT` rows, then **stops** — so it charges
  `storage_row_read` (and the filter's `operator_eval`s) only for the rows up to that point, not the
  whole table. `SELECT v FROM u LIMIT 2` over a 5-row table reads 2 rows, not 5. This is the
  deliberate cost change; it is genuine (the scan really stops — leaves past the stop point are never
  faulted), not a post-hoc truncation, so the cost honestly bounds the work (CLAUDE.md §13).
- **`page_read` does NOT short-circuit** — it stays the full block (the scan bound's node count
  plus the bound's overflow chain pages and `value_decompress` slabs, charged up front), so a
  `LIMIT` does not lower it. Keeping
  `page_read` the structural count preserves its "logical, buffer-pool-invisible" definition and one
  accrual model across all scans; the row reads are where the early-out shows. (Tightening
  `page_read` to the leaves actually faulted is a possible later refinement; it would only matter
  for a very large multi-leaf table.)
- **An `ORDER BY` (or any blocking operator) keeps the full scan.** Those must materialize every row
  before windowing, so they charge `storage_row_read` for all of them — the rule at the top of this
  section. This is why every `LIMIT`-with-`ORDER BY` cost in `query/limit_offset.test` scans all
  rows, while the `LIMIT`-without-`ORDER BY` cases short-circuit.
- **Composes with the PK bound.** A `WHERE pk <range> ... LIMIT n` first bounds the scan to the key
  range (above), then short-circuits within it once `n` rows are produced.
- **The rows are identical** to the eager path: the `offset..offset+limit` slice of the
  primary-key-ordered filtered rows. (The *result set* of a `LIMIT` with no `ORDER BY` is
  SQL-unspecified — CLAUDE.md §8 — but our cores agree, scanning in primary-key order.)

`query/limit_offset.test` pins these costs cross-core (a uniform-value table makes the no-`ORDER BY`
subset deterministic so a specific result can be asserted alongside the `# cost:`).

### `SELECT DISTINCT` — the projection-vs-produce asymmetry

`DISTINCT` ([grammar.md](grammar.md) §11) deduplicates the **projected** output, so it must
project *every* filtered row to compute its dedup key — there is no way to know a row is a
duplicate without evaluating its select list. That splits two charges the un-`DISTINCT` path
keeps together:

- **Projection `operator_eval` is charged per *filtered* row**, not per windowed row — for
  each filtered row, every interior projection node fires once. This is independent of
  `LIMIT`/`OFFSET` and of how many rows turn out to be duplicates; the work is genuinely
  done. (Leaf `column`/constant projections still charge nothing, so a bare-column
  `SELECT DISTINCT a` adds no projection cost at all.)
- **`row_produced` is charged per *emitted* row** — the rows surviving dedup **and** the
  window — unchanged from its "one per row in the result set, post-`LIMIT`/`OFFSET`"
  definition (now also post-`DISTINCT`). So `row_produced` always equals the output row
  count.
- **Dedup itself is unmetered**, like the `ORDER BY` sort and the `LIMIT` slice (a dedicated
  dedup-comparison unit could be added later, as for the sort).

A consequence worth stating because it is observable and is a cross-core abort-point contract
(§6): because all filtered rows are projected, a projection that traps fires **even under a
`LIMIT` that would exclude the offending row**. `SELECT DISTINCT 1/a FROM t LIMIT 1` traps
`22012` if *any* filtered row has `a = 0`, whereas un-`DISTINCT` `SELECT 1/a FROM t LIMIT 1`
windows first and does not. The trapping row is deterministic (primary-key scan order), so
all three cores trap identically.

### JOIN — multi-table FROM (the nested-loop contract)

A multi-table `SELECT` ([grammar.md](grammar.md) §15) is a **left-deep nested-loop** join. Its
cost is pinned here because, with no reference implementation, the count is a cross-core contract
(§1). Three rules, each a small extension of the single-table rules above:

- **`storage_row_read` is charged once per physical row as each base table is materialized** —
  total = the **sum of the table cardinalities** (`|A| + |B| + …`), independent of join order or
  fan-out. A row is pulled from its store exactly once (each table is scanned into memory in
  primary-key order); the nested loop then re-reads from that **in-memory** buffer, which is not a
  store and charges nothing. This keeps the existing rule verbatim ("once per row pulled from a
  store, in the executor loop not the storage iterator" — so the Rust lazy-iterator vs Go/TS
  materialized-slice split stays neutralized) and keeps single-table cost identical (one table →
  its cardinality). When a table is **bounded** by a WHERE predicate on its own primary key
  (`query.join_pushdown`, "Bounded scan / JOIN" above), only its in-range rows are materialized, so
  its `storage_row_read` (and `page_read`) is the bounded count, not the full cardinality — a miss
  materializes zero. The bound never changes the result, only which rows are scanned.
- **The `ON`-predicate `operator_eval` is charged per candidate combination** the join evaluates
  it against — for an `INNER JOIN`, once per (running-row × right-row) pair, the `ON` tree's
  interior nodes firing pre-order with **no short-circuit**, exactly like a WHERE. A `CROSS JOIN`
  has no `ON` and charges no join `operator_eval` (it keeps every pair). So `ON` cost =
  |running| × |right| × (interior nodes in the `ON`), deterministic and fan-out-explicit. The
  iteration order — running/left side outer in PK order, right side inner in PK order, left-deep —
  is fixed so the per-combination evals accrue in the same sequence in every core (a §8 surface;
  it fixes the cost-ceiling abort point even though only the total is asserted today).
- **WHERE `operator_eval`** is charged per **surviving combined row** (post-join), and
  **`row_produced`** per emitted output row (post-`LIMIT`/`OFFSET`) — both unchanged; the combined
  row is simply wider. Join materialization buffering, the nested-loop control flow, and row
  concatenation are **unmetered**, like the `ORDER BY` sort and the `LIMIT` slice.

**Worked example.** Tables `a` (3 rows), `b` (2 rows), each small enough to be a single leaf
page; `SELECT * FROM a JOIN b ON a.k = b.k`, with 2 pairs surviving the `ON`. Materialize `a` →
1 `page_read` + 3 `storage_row_read`; materialize `b` → 1 + 2; the `ON` (`a.k = b.k`, one
interior `compare` node — its operands are leaf columns, charging nothing) over 3 × 2 = 6
candidate pairs → 6 `operator_eval`; no WHERE; `*` is bare-column projection (leaves, charge
nothing); 2 emitted rows → 2 `row_produced`. **Total = (1 + 3) + (1 + 2) + 6 + 2 = 15.** A
`CROSS JOIN` of the same tables emits all 6 pairs and evaluates no `ON`: 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 6 =
**13**.

**OUTER joins charge identically — only the produced-row count grows.** `LEFT`/`RIGHT`/`FULL [OUTER]
JOIN` ([grammar.md](grammar.md) §15) evaluate the `ON` over the **same** `|running| × |right|`
candidate set (so the `ON` `operator_eval` count is unchanged from an INNER join of the same tables);
a row that matches nothing is then **NULL-extended on the absent side and added to the surviving set
without re-evaluating `ON`** — the NULL-extension itself is unmetered, like row concatenation. Those
NULL-extended rows are ordinary surviving combined rows, so they incur WHERE `operator_eval` and
`row_produced` exactly like matched rows. So for the example tables with `SELECT * FROM a LEFT JOIN b
ON a.k = b.k` where 1 `a`-row matches 1 `b`-row and the other 2 `a`-rows match nothing: 1 + 3 and
1 + 2 to materialize (one leaf page each), 6 `ON`, no WHERE, and 1 matched + 2 NULL-extended = 3
emitted rows → **(1 + 3) + (1 + 2) + 6 + 3 = 16** (the INNER form of the same query is
`… + 1 = 14`; the +2 is the two preserved-left rows).

### Set operations — `lhs + rhs`, the combine unmetered

A set operation ([grammar.md](grammar.md) §25) — `UNION`/`INTERSECT`/`EXCEPT`, each with an
optional `ALL` — combines the result sets of two operand queries. Its cost is the **sum of the
operand costs and nothing more**:

> `cost(a ⊕ b) = cost(a) + cost(b)`

Each operand is a full `select_core` (or a nested set operation) run through the ordinary query
path, so it **already** charges `storage_row_read` per scanned row, the `operator_eval`s of its
own clauses, and `row_produced` per row it emits (its *pre-combine* output). The set-operation
layer then consumes those materialized rows and does **only set-membership work** — match rows by
the NULL-safe value-canonical key, take the multiset union / intersection / difference, emit the
representative rows — which is **unmetered**, exactly like `DISTINCT` dedup (above), the
`ORDER BY` sort, and the `LIMIT`/`OFFSET` slice. The trailing `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`/`OFFSET` of a
set operation are likewise unmetered (§ "What is NOT metered"). The integer→`decimal` value
conversion that type unification may apply before keying (§25) is structural, like a JOIN's
NULL-extension, and charges nothing. **No new cost unit** is introduced.

This **follows the `INSERT … SELECT` precedent** (§24, where the wrapping statement adds nothing
to the embedded `SELECT`'s cost), not the single-`SELECT` shape. A deliberate consequence: the
`DISTINCT` invariant "`row_produced` equals the output row count" **does not hold** for a set
operation — the operands charge `row_produced` for their *pre-combine* rows, and the combine that
drops/duplicates rows is unmetered, so the accrued `row_produced` reflects what the operands
produced, not the set operation's final output. This is correct and intended: cost composes from
the independently-metered subqueries.

**Worked example.** Tables `a` (3 rows) and `b` (2 rows), each a single leaf page;
`SELECT x FROM a UNION SELECT x FROM b`. The left operand materializes `a` → 1 `page_read` +
3 `storage_row_read` and emits 3 rows → 3 `row_produced` (a bare-column projection is a leaf,
charging no `operator_eval`): 7. The right operand: 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. The `UNION` dedup is
unmetered. **Total = 7 + 5 = 12**, whatever the number of distinct output rows. `UNION ALL`
(no dedup) costs the **same** 12 — the dedup was already free, so dropping it changes nothing.
The cross-core contract is trivially identical: it is literally the sum of two
independently-deterministic operand costs.

### Subqueries — initplan once, correlated per outer row

A subquery ([grammar.md](grammar.md) §26) — scalar `(SELECT …)`, `x IN (SELECT …)`, or
`EXISTS (SELECT …)` — composes its operand query's cost into the enclosing query with **no new
cost unit**. The subquery runs through the ordinary query path, so it **already** charges its
own `storage_row_read` / `operator_eval` / `row_produced` exactly as any `SELECT` does; the
folding/membership/cardinality machinery is **unmetered**, like `DISTINCT` dedup and the
set-operation combine. How many times that operand cost lands depends on correlation:

- **Uncorrelated** (an "initplan") — executed **exactly once**, at plan setup, and folded into a
  constant. Its cost is added **once**, and the folded constant is a **leaf** (charges no
  `operator_eval` when the outer row evaluates), so a scalar subquery referenced once in `WHERE`
  adds its operand cost once, not once per outer row:

  > `cost(query with uncorrelated s) = cost(query) + cost(s)`

  A globally-uncorrelated subquery is folded once **even when it is nested inside a correlated
  one** (its value never changes), so it too is counted once.

- **Correlated** — re-executed once **per outer row** that reaches its expression node, reading
  the enclosing-row values its plan references. Each execution adds that execution's full
  operand cost (which can vary per outer row, since the correlated values filter the inner scan
  differently), and the subquery node itself — being a real interior operator now, not a folded
  leaf — charges **one `operator_eval`** each time it evaluates. A correlated `IN` additionally
  charges one `operator_eval` per inner result value its membership test compares (the §26 IN
  model). So for a correlated subquery `s` reached by outer rows `R`:

  > `cost(query with correlated s) = cost(query) + Σ_{r ∈ R} (operator_eval + cost(s | r))`

  When the inner query is a single table whose WHERE bounds its **primary key** by an enclosing
  column (`inner.pk = o.col`), each `cost(s | r)` is the **bounded** inner scan for that outer
  row's value — a per-outer-row point lookup/range, not a full re-scan (see "Bounded scan /
  correlated" above; `query.correlated_pushdown`). The Σ shrinks accordingly, but the formula is
  unchanged — only each term is smaller.

Both are fully deterministic and identical across cores: the same `(query, database)` always
visits the same outer rows in the same order and runs the subquery the same number of times.

The same accounting applies when the enclosing statement is a **`DELETE` / `UPDATE`** (a
subquery in its `WHERE`, or an `UPDATE` assignment RHS — grammar.md §26): an uncorrelated
subquery folds once (operand cost added once, before the scan), and a correlated one re-runs
per **scanned** row that reaches its node, adding `operator_eval + cost(s | r)` each time —
identical to the `SELECT` case, since both mutations drive the same per-row evaluator. The
phase-2 writes evaluate nothing and stay unmetered (below).

### What is NOT metered (defined boundary)

Metering covers **execution** — per-row scans, per-row produced, per-row expression
evaluation. It deliberately does **not** meter:

- **Parse / plan / resolve** — these are per-statement (and the literal range-checks,
  type resolution, etc. happen once), not per-row execution.
- **`ORDER BY` sort-internal comparisons** — the sort compares `Value`s directly, not
  through the expression evaluator, so they are outside the `operator_eval` unit (and the
  `decimal_work` unit — `MIN`/`MAX` folds are the same direct compare and share this
  boundary). This holds for a **multi-key** sort too (each key's comparison is the same
  direct `Value` compare), so adding keys or `NULLS FIRST|LAST` placement changes no cost.
  (A dedicated sort-comparison unit could be added later if wanted; it is not in this slice.)
- **`LIMIT` / `OFFSET` slicing** — selecting the output window is an index slice over the
  already-sorted rows, not evaluation work; like the sort it is unmetered. Its only cost
  effect is *fewer* `row_produced`/projection charges (the excluded rows are never
  projected — see the `row_produced` rule above).
- **`DISTINCT` dedup** — testing whether a projected tuple has been seen is set membership,
  not evaluation, so it is unmetered like the sort and the slice. Its cost effect is the
  asymmetry above: projection `operator_eval` is charged for every filtered row, but
  `row_produced` only for the surviving distinct, windowed rows.
- **Phase-2 row writes** in `UPDATE`/`DELETE` — the two-phase mutation's write pass does
  no eval and produces no row.
- **JOIN nested-loop control flow** — buffering each materialized table, iterating the
  Cartesian/left-deep combinations, and concatenating left+right rows are bookkeeping, not
  evaluation; only `storage_row_read` (per materialized row), the `ON`/WHERE/projection
  `operator_eval`s, and `row_produced` accrue (see the JOIN subsection above).
- **Set-operation combine** — matching rows by the NULL-safe value-canonical key, the multiset
  union/intersection/difference, the integer→`decimal` unification conversion, and the trailing
  `ORDER BY`/`LIMIT`/`OFFSET` are all set-membership / bookkeeping, not evaluation; a set
  operation accrues only its operands' costs (`lhs + rhs`, see the set-operations subsection
  above).

## 4. Counter representation — exactness across cores (CLAUDE.md §8)

The accrued cost is carried as a signed 64-bit integer: `i64` (Rust), `int64` (Go),
**`bigint` (TS)**. TS must use `bigint`, not `number`: a `number` is an IEEE-754 `f64`,
and a large scan crosses 2^53 where `f64` loses integer precision, silently diverging
from the Rust/Go `i64` totals — exactly the §8 hotspot the type system exists to kill.
The TS core already carries int64 values as `bigint`, so this is consistent. Cost renders
as a plain shortest-decimal integer, matching the `# cost: N` corpus directive.

## 5. The seam shape (so enforcement is additive)

Every accrual routes through a single `Meter::charge(units)` chokepoint per core (a tiny
`Meter` struct threaded by `&mut`/pointer/mutable-object through the executors and the
recursive evaluator). The accrued total is exposed on `Outcome` (both the statement and
query variants — a `DELETE` still accrues scan + filter cost). Centralizing accrual in
`charge`, with the ceiling check factored into `Meter::guard()`, is what kept enforcement a
local change (§6).

## 6. Enforcement — the cost ceiling (landed)

The metering seam (§5) exists so that bounding an untrusted query is a small, local addition.
It is now built:

- **Caller-set ceiling.** The handle carries a `max_cost` setting (spec/design/api.md §8),
  `0` (the default) ⇒ **unlimited**, a positive value ⇒ the ceiling. Each statement's `Meter`
  is constructed with that limit. It is a handle setting, not stored in the file — the host
  configures the budget for whatever handle serves untrusted queries.
- **Deterministic abort via `guard()`.** `charge` stays a pure accrual chokepoint (so the
  `# cost:` accrual contract is **byte-unchanged**); a separate `Meter::guard()` does the
  comparison and **aborts when accrued cost has reached the ceiling** (`accrued >= limit`,
  CLAUDE.md §13 — "the instant accrued cost reaches it"). The ceiling is therefore the first
  *disallowed* value: a query whose true cost equals the ceiling aborts, one costing
  `ceiling − 1` completes. `guard()` is consulted at the **unbounded-work points** — once per
  scanned row (the SELECT/JOIN materialization, the DELETE and UPDATE scans, the streaming
  LIMIT walk), once per produced row, once per expression node (the recursive evaluator's
  entry), once per aggregate fold row, and **immediately after each size-scaled
  `decimal_work` charge** (§3 — so the ceiling aborts *before* the big-decimal limb work
  runs, not at the next node). These points are **mirrored identically across
  Rust, Go, and TS**, and accrual order is fixed (§3), so the abort is deterministic and
  **cross-core identical**: the same `(query, db, ceiling)` aborts (or completes) in every
  core. A subquery executes through the same path with the same `max_cost`, so a runaway
  correlated re-scan aborts within its own execution; the outer meter additionally accrues the
  subquery's cost (`charge(r.cost)`), so the outer scan guard sees the running total. The
  guard is a single comparison and a **no-op when unlimited**, so it is free on the hot path
  by default.
  - **Surfacing differs per core, the abort point does not.** Rust returns `Result` (the
    guard is `m.guard()?`), Go returns `error` (`if err := m.Guard(); err != nil`), TS
    **throws** the `EngineError` (which unwinds to the API boundary like every other SQL
    error) — each its own idiom, all aborting at the same guarded point. The abort is an
    **ordinary engine error**, so it flows through the existing rollback-on-error paths
    untouched: an aborted autocommit DELETE/UPDATE discards its working set and leaves the
    table unchanged, and inside an explicit block the abort poisons the block (§transactions).
  - **Bounded overshoot, by design.** Because `guard()` is checked at the work-loop
    boundaries rather than inside every `charge`, accrued cost can pass the ceiling by at most
    the work of one unit between two guards — one row's filter/projection, one expression
    subtree, or one folded row (the membership loop over an `IN`-subquery's result is bounded
    by that result, which a guarded inner scan already capped). The overshoot is itself
    deterministic and cross-core identical. Tightening `page_read`'s single up-front block
    charge, and a single global running counter across subquery nesting, are possible later
    refinements; neither changes the abort *decision* for a `(query, db, ceiling)`.
- **Cost-ceiling error code — `54P01` `cost_limit_exceeded`.** Authored in
  [../errors/registry.toml](../errors/registry.toml), class `54` *program_limit_exceeded* (a
  caller-imposed limit was exceeded). jed-specific — PostgreSQL has no execution-cost ceiling,
  so it is a documented divergence (CLAUDE.md §1/§13), the `P` subclass marking it as jed's,
  like the existing `22P02`/`42P18`/`25P02`.
- **Conformance.** The `# max_cost: N` directive (mirroring `# cost:`) runs the next record
  under a ceiling of N; an over-ceiling record is `statement error 54P01`, an under-ceiling
  record runs normally and may assert its `# cost:`.
  [../conformance/suites/resource/cost_limit.test](../conformance/suites/resource/cost_limit.test)
  pins both directions cross-core, gated by the `resource.cost_limit` capability.

Other items recorded against the seam:

- **A real `page_read` unit — ✅ landed (P6.3).** The store is now a page-backed B-tree
  ([storage.md](storage.md) §6), so a distinct `page_read` unit was **added** to the schedule
  (not a rename of `storage_row_read` — both fire on a scan) and is charged per node a scan
  touches. It counts a **logical** page access (the tree's structural node count), **not** a
  physical disk fetch, so the future buffer pool / cache for larger-than-RAM files
  (CLAUDE.md §9) cannot perturb the deterministic, cache-independent cost (§13). Accrual
  rules: §3 "`page_read`".
- **Per-operator `cost` weights.** A uniform `operator_eval` weight now; the per-operator
  `cost` field in [../functions/catalog.toml](../functions/catalog.toml) stays reserved
  ([functions.md](functions.md) §8). Authoring it later (evaluator preferring the
  operator's `cost`, falling back to `operator_eval`) is purely additive.
