## 1. What this refines, and the accident it corrects

The first host API ([api.md §1](api.md)) made **`Database`** do two unrelated jobs at once:

1. **Storage identity** — the committed in-memory state plus the persistence identity (`path`,
   the monotonic `txid`, the `page_size` the file is serialized with, the buffer pool).
2. **The configured handle** — `max_cost`, `work_mem`, `read_only`, the entropy/clock sources
   ([api.md §8/§10](api.md)): per-caller policy that has nothing to do with *which file* is open.

This is the same fusion [transactions.md §1](transactions.md) already diagnosed and un-fused
once (transaction boundary vs. durability). The fix is identical in spirit: **separate storage
identity from the session context.**

- **`Database`** keeps the storage identity — `path`, `txid`, `page_size`, the committed
  `Snapshot`, the buffer pool, `synchronous` (a property of *this file's* durability), and the
  **physical read-only-file** flag ([api.md §2.1](api.md), OS-enforced, `25006` — distinct from
  session *authorization*, §5.1).
- **`Session`** is the configured, stateful context opened *over* a `Database`. It carries the
  capability envelope, the cost meters, the entropy/clock seam, session variables, and the time
  zone; statements run on a session (autocommit) or on a `Transaction` opened from one.

Session-scoped state already exists implicitly — `currval`/`lastval` raise `55000` "before
`nextval` … in this session" ([sequences.md §6](sequences.md)). The session is simply the
explicit home that state always lacked.

**Why "session," not "connection."** Every new control here is, in PostgreSQL, *session
state*: the time zone is the `TimeZone` GUC, session variables are user GUCs (`SET` /
`current_setting`), read-only is `default_transaction_read_only`, the cost budgets are
`statement_timeout`-style session limits. Since jed's north star is PostgreSQL's behavior
(CLAUDE.md §1), naming this `Session` lets the SQL surface be PG-faithful (`SET` / `SHOW` /
`current_setting()` / `SET TIME ZONE`) rather than inventing parallel vocabulary. jed is
embedded with no wire connection to establish, so "connection" would be less honest.

**Back-compat is total.** A bare `Database` owns **one long-lived default session** (§2.1) with
default settings, so `Database::new()`, `open`/`create`, the free `execute(db, sql)`, and every
conformance harness keep working unchanged ([api.md §2.4](api.md)). The explicit `db.session(opts)`
is additive — reached only when a host wants a second, independently-configured envelope. (There is
no interface-stability constraint yet — nothing depends on this surface — so the refinement takes
the clean shape, not a compatible one.)

## 2. The shape and lifecycle

```
Database ─ committed storage (Snapshot, txid), shared by every session
  │ owns one                                db.session(opts) ─▶ additional Session(s)
  ▼
default Session ─ stateful: txn status · vars · time zone · cost meters · currval
  │   db.execute / db.query / db.execute_script   (run on it; split_statements is library-level)
  └─  begin / view / update  +  SQL BEGIN / COMMIT / ROLLBACK  ─▶  Idle ⇄ Open ⇄ Failed
```

### 2.1 The default session, and where state lives

`Database` owns **exactly one long-lived default `Session`.** The bare convenience methods —
`db.execute`, `db.query`, `db.begin`/`view`/`update`, `db.execute_script` (§4) — are **defined as**
operating on that default session, so it is **stateful**: an open `BEGIN` block, session variables,
the time zone, and the cost meters all persist across calls on it, exactly like a PostgreSQL /
SQLite connection. `db.session(opts) -> Session` mints **additional, independent** sessions with
their own state and envelope (`opts` is the `SessionOptions` of §3; an absent field takes its
default).

State ownership splits cleanly — the load-bearing rule:

- **Committed data state** — the `Snapshot` and `txid` — lives on **`Database`**, shared by every
  session and surviving all of them. An autocommit statement on *any* session publishes here, so a
  `CREATE TABLE` on one session is visible to the next ([api.md §6](api.md) committed-snapshot reads).
- **Session state** — the transaction status (§2.2), session variables, time zone, and the
  per-statement/lifetime cost meters — lives on **`Session`**, private to it, gone when it closes.
  Session *settings* do **not** roll back with a transaction (PG `SET SESSION`; `SET LOCAL` is a
  deferred exception, §10). (Sequence `currval`/counter semantics are [sequences.md](sequences.md)'s
  — the counter is *transactional* and rolls back, a documented PG divergence; the "have I called
  `nextval` this session" state that raises `55000` is session-local.)

The default session is stateful, so a host that drives it across calls drives it from **one**
caller at a time (it carries an open `BEGIN` block, the time zone, the cost meters). For **genuine
concurrency** — many readers running alongside a writer — a host mints **additional sessions**
(`db.session(opts)` / `db.read_session()` / `db.write_session()`), each an independently-usable
per-caller handle over the one shared `Database`. This is the **converged** shape (§2.4): a
`Session` *is* the configured concurrency handle, so there is no separate `SharedDb`/`ReadHandle`/
`WriteHandle` surface — the session is both the envelope and the handle.

### 2.2 The transaction state machine

A session carries an explicit **transaction status**, mirroring PostgreSQL's three connection states:

- **`Idle`** — autocommit; each statement is its own transaction.
- **`Open{writable}`** — inside an explicit transaction.
- **`Failed`** — open but poisoned: only `ROLLBACK` / `COMMIT` (the latter acting as rollback) are
  accepted, every other statement is `25P02` ([transactions.md §6](transactions.md), unchanged).

There is **one** state machine with **three entry points** — this is what removes the
`BEGIN`-vs-`session.begin` overlap:

| entry point | role |
|---|---|
| SQL `BEGIN` / `COMMIT` / `ROLLBACK` | the open-ended / interactive spelling; `Idle ⇄ Open` |
| `session.begin(writable)` / `commit()` / `rollback()` | the **same** transitions, from the host API |
| `session.view(fn)` / `session.update(fn)` | **scoped sugar**: require `Idle`, open → run `fn` → commit/rollback → `Idle`; panic-safe |

`session.begin` and SQL `BEGIN` are two spellings of one transition; the closures are the bounded,
guaranteed-to-close wrapper. Consequently the separate **`Transaction` object** the first
[api.md §6](api.md) draft carried **collapses**: statements run *on the session*, and a
`Transaction` is at most optional per-core RAII sugar (Rust rollback-on-drop) driving the session —
never an independent state holder ([api.md §2.2/§6](api.md) are revised to match when S1 lands, §10).

**Can a session sit in a transaction indefinitely?**

- Via `view` / `update`: **no** — the transaction's lifetime *is* the closure; it cannot outlive `fn`.
- Via `BEGIN` (SQL or `session.begin`): **yes, open-ended** — until `COMMIT` / `ROLLBACK` / `close`.
  Intended for interactive use (the CLI/REPL), but a **writable** open transaction holds the
  single-writer lock ([transactions.md §10](transactions.md)) and **starves every other writer**
  while held. The guard is the Bucket-A **`idle_in_transaction_timeout`** setting (§3; PG's
  `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout`): an open transaction idle past the bound is auto-rolled-back
  and the session returned to `Idle` (`25P03`). Default off (unbounded), like the cost ceilings;
  enforcement is a deferred slice (§11).

**Autocommit and the implicit script transaction are the same mechanism.** A single statement on an
`Idle` session wraps that one statement in a transaction; `execute_script` (§4) on an `Idle` session
wraps the *sequence*. The multi-statement path is **not** a new transaction concept — it is
autocommit generalized to a statement sequence. A statement (or script) run while the session is
already `Open` simply joins that transaction.

### 2.3 Close, and the shared handle

`session.close()` releases the session and **rolls back any open transaction it owns** (mirroring
[api.md §2.3](api.md)); the underlying `Database` and other sessions over it are unaffected.
Idempotent. Closing the default session closes the `Database`.

The earlier refinement specified the settings/state layer separately from the `SharedDb` /
`ReadHandle` / `WriteHandle` concurrency surface ([api.md §2.5](api.md)). §2.4 **converges** the
two: a `Session` *is* the per-caller concurrency handle, so a read-only session is what a
`ReadHandle` was and a writable session what a `WriteHandle` was — one type, one surface.

### 2.4 Convergence: `Database` is the shared core, `Session` is the concurrent handle

The first concurrency surface (api.md §2.5) was a *separate* `SharedDb` that minted `ReadHandle` /
`WriteHandle`, each wrapping a private single-threaded `Database`, while `Session` (the envelope
above) ran by **swapping** into a `Database`'s one default-session slot — two parallel surfaces for
what is conceptually one thing: *a configured, isolated, per-caller handle.* They **converge into
two types**, eliminating the third:

```
Database ─ THE SHARED CORE (cheap to clone/share across threads):
  │          committed cell (file + shared-temp roots) · single-writer gate · reader watermark
  │          · storage identity (path · page_size · pager/buffer-pool)
  │ owns one default Session (back-compat)      db.session/read_session/write_session(opts)
  ▼                                                          │ mint additional
default Session ──────────────── Session ◀──────────────────┘
   a per-caller handle = the envelope (§3) + a private Engine (committed snapshot / working set /
   open tx) + an access mode. Independently usable; readers run concurrently with the one writer.
```

- **`Database` absorbs the shared core.** It *is* what `SharedDb` was — the committed-roots cell
  (the file `Snapshot` + the shared-temp `Snapshot`, published together, transactions.md §8/§10),
  the single-writer gate, and the live-reader watermark — fused with the **storage identity** (§1:
  `path`, `page_size`, the pager/buffer-pool). It is **cheap to clone and safe to share across
  threads**, and it is what `new` / `open` / `create` return ([api.md §2.1/§2.5](api.md)). The
  old single-threaded executor handle named `Database` is **renamed `Engine`** — an internal type a
  `Session` owns privately; it is never the host surface.
- **`Session` absorbs the per-caller handle.** A session owns a private `Engine` (its committed
  snapshot / working set / open transaction) plus the §3 envelope plus an **access mode**. Because
  each session runs on its *own* `Engine`, the `activate`/swap mechanism **is deleted** — additional
  sessions no longer run sequentially by borrowing one slot; they are genuinely independent. A
  read-only session pins an immutable snapshot and is never blocked by, nor blocks, the writer; a
  writable session takes the single-writer gate (below). This is the `ReadHandle`/`WriteHandle`
  fold-in the prior refinement deferred.

**The lazy-gate lifecycle (the unified, PG-like rule).** A session does not hold the write gate for
its life; it acquires it only to write, mirroring a PostgreSQL backend:

- **Autocommit read** — pins the *latest* committed snapshot for that one statement; no gate. (Each
  autocommit statement sees the newest committed state, PG-faithful.)
- **Autocommit write** — acquires the gate → captures committed as a working set → applies →
  publishes at the next version (the §3 commit window) → **releases** the gate. Per-statement, so an
  idle writable session holds nothing and never starves other writers.
- **`BEGIN`** — pins one snapshot for the block and registers it in the watermark; acquires the gate
  **lazily on the block's first write** (or eagerly at `BEGIN READ WRITE`), holding it until
  `COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK`. A long-held writable block starves other writers — exactly the case
  `idle_in_transaction_timeout` (§3) guards.
- **`db.read_session()` (READ ONLY)** — pins a stable snapshot for its life, registers in the
  watermark, **never** takes the gate; a write through it is `25006`. `db.write_session()` /
  `db.session()` default to READ WRITE (lazy gate as above). The access mode is the §3 read-only
  property, now carried by the session.
- **Second concurrent writer** — **blocks** until the holder releases (Rust/Go true threads) or is
  rejected **`25001`** (TS, which cannot block its one thread). Unchanged from api.md §2.5.

**The default session is the back-compat bridge.** `Database` owns one long-lived default session
and `db.execute`/`db.query`/`db.begin`/`db.status`/`db.execute_script` delegate to it (§2.1), so the
single-handle surface — and every conformance harness, example, and the web worker bridge that uses
it — is **unchanged**. The default session is a writable session under the lazy-gate rule, so its
autocommit writes take the gate per statement and coexist with additional sessions. The two former
surfaces are now one: today's "bare `Database` + its default session" *is* the single-handle path;
today's `SharedDb.read()/write()` *are* `db.read_session()/write_session()`.

**File-backed sessions add two correctness requirements** absent in-memory (where snapshots are pure
COW structure-sharing): (a) the **pager/buffer-pool must be safe under concurrent reader page-faults
running alongside a committing writer** (the gate serializes writers, but readers fault pages
concurrently); (b) **page reclamation must be watermark-gated** — the commit allocator must not reuse
a free-list page still referenced by a live reader's pinned snapshot (transactions.md §8 earmarked
the watermark for exactly this; it goes live here). TS is unaffected by (a) — no threads.

**Per-core reality differs, by design** (CLAUDE.md §2 — best experience per language, not uniform
parallelism): Rust and Go give true OS-thread parallelism (reader threads run while a writer
commits); TS gives snapshot **isolation** across async interleavings (a pinned reader sees one stable
version even as a writer commits between its calls), minus the parallelism, with a second writer
**rejected `25001`** rather than blocked.

**Testing is unchanged in kind** (transactions.md §10): logical transaction/visibility semantics stay
in the **shared corpus** (the `# format: concurrency` schedules run byte-identically over the new
API); the scheduling-dependent mechanism — reader-doesn't-block, writer-exclusive, watermark
tracking, `25006`/`25001` — stays in **per-core tests** (Rust/Go fan out real threads under the race
detector; TS asserts isolation across interleaved calls). The corpus and its results do **not**
change; only the harness *driver*'s API calls migrate (`SharedDb`→`Database`, `read()/write()`→
`read_session()/write_session()`).

## 3. The two buckets — what a session carries

`SessionOptions` splits cleanly into two kinds of setting, and the distinction is **load-bearing
because they have different conformance contracts**:

| setting | bucket | default | affects | corpus |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `default_privileges` | A — envelope | `{SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE}` | per-table DML ops permitted on *every* table (`42501`) | `# default_privileges:` |
| `grant` / `revoke` | A — envelope | empty | per-table & per-function privilege deltas (`42501`) | `# grant:` / `# revoke:` |
| `allow_ddl` | A — envelope | on | whether DDL (schema changes) is permitted (`42501`) | `# allow_ddl:` |
| `max_cost` | A — envelope | `0` (unlimited) | per-statement abort (`54P01`) | `# max_cost:` (existing) |
| `max_sql_length` | A — envelope | 1 MiB | parse-size abort (`54000`) | `# max_sql_length:` (existing) |
| `lifetime_max_cost` | A — envelope | `0` (unlimited) | per-session cumulative abort (`54P02`) | concurrency-style schedule |
| `idle_in_transaction_timeout` | A — envelope | `0` (off) | auto-rollback of an idle open txn (`25P03`, §2.2) | ordered schedule *(deferred, §11)* |
| `work_mem` | A — envelope | 256 MiB | *when* an operator spills (never results) | invariant (spill.md §6) |
| session variables | B — semantic | empty | `current_setting()` / `SHOW` results | `# set:` |
| `time_zone` | B — semantic | `UTC` | `timestamptz`↔`date`/`text` casts, `AT TIME ZONE` | `# timezone:` |
| random / clock source | B — semantic | OS draws | generator values (entropy.md) | `# seed:` / `# clock:` (existing) |

The coarse **physical** read-only file / `BEGIN READ ONLY` transaction (`25006`) is a
`Database`/transaction property, **not** a session setting (§5.1); a read-only *session* is
expressed in the privilege model as `default_privileges = {SELECT}` + `allow_ddl = off`.

- **Bucket A — the safety/authorization envelope.** Governs what a statement is *allowed* to do;
  violations are deterministic errors. This is the **untrusted-query envelope** (CLAUDE.md §13)
  made concrete (§5): a session granted only `SELECT` on the tables it needs (`default_privileges`
  + per-table `grant`) + per-statement-capped + lifetime-budgeted is exactly what a host wraps
  around adversarial SQL.
- **Bucket B — semantic settings.** Feed query *results*, so they are part of the conformance
  contract and must be deterministic and byte-identical across cores (§6). They make the session
  the engine's **fourth host seam**, alongside storage, cost, and entropy/clock (§6).

`work_mem` sits in A by housekeeping (it is an envelope/resource knob) but, like `max_cost`,
**never changes what a query observes** ([spill.md §6](spill.md)) — only when an operator spills.

## 4. Multi-statement input — the splitter, not a buffering batch

Until now jed is strictly single-statement per call ([cost.md §7a](cost.md)). A host still needs to
run a *string of several statements* — a migration, a data import, a `.sql` file. The obvious shape
— an `execute_batch(sql) -> Vec<Outcome>` that buffers every statement's result rows — is **wrong**:
materializing all results *simultaneously* is an unbounded buffer, so the multi-statement interface
would itself violate the §13 "cannot exhaust resources" guarantee. There is therefore **no
simple-protocol batch executor.** The engine provides a **library-level primitive** (no `Session`,
no `Database`) and one thin **session convenience** built on it; the host owns the policy.

### 4.1 The primitive — `split_statements`, a library-level statement iterator

```
split_statements(sql) -> Iterator<Item = StatementSpan>   # top-level core export; no Session/Database
```

A pure, streaming **statement splitter** that operates on a **string and nothing else** — it
depends on neither `Session` nor `Database`, so it is a **top-level core export** (conceptually part
of the parser/lexer surface, [grammar.md](grammar.md)), callable before any database is even opened.
It is documented *here* because the multi-statement *use case* is, not because it belongs to the
session. It scans the input at the **lexer level** — respecting string literals, dollar-quoted
strings, and line/block comments, so a `;` inside them is never a boundary — and **yields one
statement's source text at a time**, lazily. Empty spans (a trailing `;`, blank/comment-only text
between separators) are **skipped**. It allocates **no parse tree** (an O(n) scan) and buffers
**nothing** across statements. Each `StatementSpan` carries its source text and byte offset (for
error reporting).

This is the whole new mechanism. **Execution is unchanged** — the host feeds each span to the
existing single-statement path (`session.execute` / `session.query` / `session.prepare`), so every
existing bound applies per statement *for free*: `max_sql_length` and the `54001` depth limit at
each parse, `max_cost` (`54P01`) per statement, the `lifetime_max_cost` budget (`54P02`) across the
run, the privilege checks (`42501`), and the streaming `Rows` cursor for results. **The host owns
the policy** — wrap the loop in one transaction or autocommit each, drain a statement's rows or drop
them — because it is just a loop over normal single-statement calls:

```
for stmt in split_statements(sql) {
    let rows = session.query(stmt.text());   // or .execute; consume or ignore — the host's call
}
```

The splitter's boundary correctness (a `;` inside a string / dollar-quote / comment is not a split)
is a lexer detail, **per-core unit tested**; it adds no SQL semantics, so it is not itself in the
shared corpus (the *behavior* of what the host runs already is).

### 4.2 The convenience — `session.execute_script`, the migration path

The dominant case — "run this script; I only care that it succeeded, not the rows" — gets a thin
helper so it is a one-liner:

```
session.execute_script(sql) -> ScriptSummary   # split + run each in order, discard result rows
```

It calls the library-level `split_statements` and runs each statement on the session, **discards result-set rows**
(keeping only counts), and — when the session is `Idle` — wraps the run in **one implicit
transaction**, all-or-nothing: any statement's error stops the run, rolls the implicit transaction
back, and returns that `EngineError`. A script run while the session is already `Open` **joins**
that transaction (no wrapper, no auto-commit — the caller's block stays open and owns the boundary,
so a mid-run error leaves the block `Failed` for the caller to roll back). `ScriptSummary` is
**`O(1)`, not `O(rows)`** — `{ statements_run, rows_affected_total, cost }` (`rows_affected_total`
sums only the DML command-tag counts — a `SELECT` contributes to neither it nor, by itself, an
error) — so memory is bounded by construction (one statement's transient result at a time,
discarded), and `lifetime_max_cost` (when it lands) bounds the total work.

**v1 narrowing — transaction control inside a script is `0A000`.** Because the implicit wrapper owns
the transaction boundary, an explicit `BEGIN` / `COMMIT` / `ROLLBACK` (or `START TRANSACTION`)
**statement inside** an `execute_script` run is rejected **`0A000 feature_not_supported`**, aborting
the run (and rolling the implicit wrapper back). The PG-simple-query **partitioning** semantics —
where an in-script `COMMIT` would partition the run into separately-committed segments and an
in-script `BEGIN` would open a nested explicit block — is a deferred follow-on (§11); the implicit
wrapper coexisting with in-script `BEGIN` is the subtlety that defers it. A host that needs
self-managed transactions in a multi-statement run writes the explicit §4.1 `split_statements` loop
instead, which has no wrapper and runs each statement under the session's own state.

A host that *does* want rows from a multi-statement run does **not** call `execute_script` — it
writes its own §4.1 loop and consumes the cursors it cares about. `execute_script` is **host-API
surface** (like `open`/`commit`/`close` and the §2 session methods), so its behavior — all-or-nothing
when `Idle`, join-when-`Open`, error-stops-the-run, the `0A000` control-statement gate, the
`ScriptSummary` counts — is **per-core unit tested**, the same way S1's session machine is
(CLAUDE.md §10: the single-statement corpus cannot *call* `execute_script`, and the transaction
*atomicity* it rests on is already corpus-covered by the transactions suite). The splitter's
boundary correctness (§4.1) is likewise per-core unit tested.

## 5. The safety envelope (bucket A)

The host is the policy decision point. CLAUDE.md §3 deletes in-database users/roles/RBAC, so
authorization is **not** a permission catalog — it is a capability envelope the host configures on
the session and the engine *mechanically enforces*. This is the host-extension boundary in the
other direction: the engine provides the containment mechanism; the host decides the policy.

### 5.1 The transaction access mode (`25006`) — distinct from privileges

The coarse "this transaction cannot write *anything*" gate stays exactly as it is: a **physically
read-only file** (`Database::open(read_only)`, [api.md §2.1](api.md), OS-enforced — no write
access at all) or a **`BEGIN READ ONLY`** transaction ([transactions.md](transactions.md)) raises
**`25006`** (PG hot-standby behavior) on **any** write, DML or DDL. It is a property of the *file*
/ *transaction*, **not** of authorization, so it is a `Database`/transaction concern, not a
session setting.

The session-level read-only/read-write *option* the first draft carried is **replaced** by the
fine-grained **privilege model** of §5.3: a read-only session is one whose `default_privileges`
is `{SELECT}` (and `allow_ddl` off), so a write resolves to **`42501`** (authorization) rather
than `25006` (access mode). The two gates are **orthogonal and compose** — a write succeeds only
if the transaction is writable (`25006` otherwise) **and** the session holds the privilege
(`42501` otherwise). A writable file may host sessions of any privilege shape.

### 5.2 Per-statement cost ceiling (relocated)

`max_cost` is the existing per-statement ceiling ([api.md §8](api.md), [cost.md §6](cost.md)) —
the instant a statement's accrued cost reaches it, execution aborts `54P01`. Unchanged except
that it lives on the session.

### 5.3 Privileges — the GRANT/REVOKE model

Authorization is **per-object, per-operation**, mirroring PostgreSQL `GRANT`/`REVOKE`. CLAUDE.md
§3 deletes in-database users/roles, so these grants are **not** a privilege catalog — the *host*
holds them on the session and the engine mechanically enforces them. One privilege set per object
kind, exactly PG's:

- **Tables** — the four DML privileges **`SELECT`**, **`INSERT`**, **`UPDATE`**, **`DELETE`** (PG's
  table privileges, minus the ones jed has no feature for — `TRUNCATE`/`TRIGGER`/`REFERENCES`).
- **Functions** — a single **`EXECUTE`** privilege (PG's function privilege).

The session expresses authorization in three layers — the analogue of `GRANT … ON ALL TABLES`
plus per-object `GRANT`/`REVOKE`:

1. **`default_privileges`** — the table-privilege set granted to **every** table (the "all tables"
   default). Default = all four, so a fresh session behaves as today. **This replaces the
   read-only/read-write boolean:** a read-only session is `default_privileges = {SELECT}`. Functions
   default to **`EXECUTE` granted on all**.
2. **`grant`** (the *whitelist*) — `grant[T]` adds privileges to a specific table *beyond* the
   default; `grant[F]` re-grants `EXECUTE` on a function the default withheld.
3. **`revoke`** (the *blacklist*) — `revoke[T]` withholds privileges from a specific table;
   `revoke[F]` withholds `EXECUTE` on a function.

**Effective privilege** for an operation `OP` on object `X`:

> `OP ∈ ( default(kind of X) ∪ grant[X] ) \ revoke[X]`

**revoke takes precedence over grant** (deny wins — order-independent, the safe default). The old
allow-list / deny-list shapes fall out as special cases: a function *allow-list* is "`EXECUTE`
default-off + per-function `grant`"; a *deny-list* is "default-on + per-function `revoke`."

**Which privilege a statement requires** (PG-faithful):

- **`SELECT`** on every table whose **columns it reads** — `FROM`/`JOIN` tables, subquery and
  scalar-subquery tables, an `INSERT … SELECT` source, and the columns an `UPDATE`/`DELETE` reads
  in its `WHERE` / assignment RHS / `RETURNING`.
- **`INSERT` / `UPDATE` / `DELETE`** on the statement's **write target**. A statement that both
  reads and writes a table needs both privileges: `UPDATE t SET … WHERE …` requires `UPDATE` *and*
  `SELECT` on `t`; a bare `INSERT INTO t VALUES …` (no read) requires only `INSERT`.
- **`EXECUTE`** on every **named function** the statement calls. Built-in *operators* are **not**
  gated — they are pure and unavoidable (CLAUDE.md §13); the function privilege is most useful for
  pinning determinism (revoke `uuidv4`/`now()`) or disabling set-returning functions.

**DDL** (CREATE / DROP / ALTER of tables, indexes, types, sequences) is **not** a per-table
privilege — jed has no schema/owner model (§3) — so a session capability **`allow_ddl`**
(default **on**) governs it; a denied schema change is `42501`. A finer per-object CREATE/ownership
privilege is a deferred follow-on (§11), with **one split already designed**: temporary-table DDL
(temp-tables.md §5). Because a temp table is bounded, never-durable scratch space a host *wants* to
expose to an otherwise-untouching untrusted session, `allow_ddl` splits by the **kind** of relation
the statement targets into three gates — **`allow_ddl`** (persistent DDL, the existing gate, name and
default unchanged), **`allow_temp_ddl`** (session-local temp DDL), and **`allow_shared_temp_ddl`**
(shared temp DDL). The two new gates **default to `allow_ddl`'s value**, so existing callers are
unaffected and the §5.3 default-deny posture holds; the untrusted-scratch pattern is
`allow_ddl = off` + explicit `allow_temp_ddl = on`. The gates land with the temp-table slices
(`allow_temp_ddl` in slice 1, `allow_shared_temp_ddl` in slice 2).

The capability envelope governs the **SQL surface** only. Privileged **host-API** maintenance ops —
`db.load_unicode_data`, `db.set_default_collation`, and `db.upgrade_collations()` (the COLLATION
UPGRADE migration, [collation.md §12](collation.md)) — are **not SQL-reachable**, so they sit
**outside** this envelope entirely: no `allow_ddl` gate applies, and an untrusted query can never
trigger them ([collation.md §11](collation.md), CLAUDE.md §13). The host decides when to call them.

**Enforcement** is at **name resolution**, after a name resolves to a catalog object: a missing
privilege raises **`42501 insufficient_privilege`** — PostgreSQL's own permission-denied code
(messages "permission denied for table t" / "for function f"), matched on the canonical
(lowercased) catalog name. The error is **explicit** — the caller learns the object exists but the
operation is off-limits (the chosen behavior over hiding existence behind `42P01`); a host wanting
to hide schema existence from adversarial callers layers that above the engine.

Deterministic and corpus-tested via the GRANT-shaped directives **`# default_privileges:`**,
**`# grant:`**, **`# revoke:`**, and **`# allow_ddl:`** (§6, §9). Capabilities: `session.privileges`
(tables + functions), `session.allow_ddl`. **v1 narrowings (relax later):** base-table and
named-function names only (not PG's per-*column* `GRANT`); `allow_ddl` is one boolean (no
per-object CREATE/ownership privilege); function `EXECUTE` defaults **on**, so only `revoke` disables
a function (the deny-list — `revoke uuidv4`/`now()` to pin determinism). A function *allow-list*
(default-off + per-function `grant`) is the symmetric shape but needs a function-default toggle the v1
`SessionOptions` (which carries only the *table* `default_privileges`) does not expose; deferred (§11).

### 5.4 Session lifetime cost budget

✅ **Landed (all 3 cores, §10 slice 4).** `max_cost` bounds **one statement**; `lifetime_max_cost`
bounds the **whole session**. The session
holds a running cumulative cost total; **every** statement (autocommit, batch, or in a
transaction) accrues its metered cost into it. Semantics, mirroring the per-statement ceiling so
the two gates compose:

- `lifetime_max_cost <= 0` (the **default**, `0`) ⇒ **unlimited** (the cumulative total is still
  tracked and readable, nothing aborts).
- `lifetime_max_cost > 0` ⇒ the instant the **session's cumulative** accrued cost reaches it,
  the running statement aborts with **`54P02 session_cost_limit_exceeded`** (a new jed-specific
  `P`-subclass code, sibling to `54P01`). A statement aborts at whichever ceiling it reaches
  first — its own `max_cost` (`54P01`) or the session budget (`54P02`).
- The budget is a hard, monotonic allowance: an aborted statement's **partial** cost still counts
  (the work happened), and once the budget is spent **every** further statement on the session is
  rejected `54P02` at admission (it cannot accrue). The meter is **session state, not snapshot
  state**, so it does **not** roll back when an aborted statement (or an explicit `ROLLBACK`)
  undoes the statement's *effects* — the compute was spent regardless. This is the clean
  "this session has a total compute allowance" model for a multi-tenant / untrusted host.

Determinism: the cumulative total is a deterministic function of the statement sequence against a
given database (each statement's cost is already deterministic and cross-core — [cost.md §1](cost.md)),
so the abort point is itself deterministic and cross-core identical. It is asserted with a
concurrency-style ordered schedule (a sequence of statements on one session, asserting the
`54P02` abort after a known cumulative cost), not the single-record `# cost:` directive (which
is per-statement). Capability: `session.lifetime_cost`.

## 6. Semantic settings (bucket B) — the fourth host seam

Bucket-B settings feed query *results*, so they join the determinism contract (CLAUDE.md §10):
their values must be byte-identical across cores and may **never** be read from the host OS
environment — reading the host locale/zone would be a determinism leak, the
[types.md §11](types.md) ICU-collation cautionary tale. The session thus becomes the engine's
**fourth host-supplied seam**, alongside storage ([storage.md](storage.md)), cost ([cost.md](cost.md)),
and entropy/clock ([entropy.md](entropy.md), [determinism.md §5](determinism.md)).

**A distinction from the clock/entropy seam.** The clock/entropy seam's *production* default
reads the nondeterministic OS (so it earns determinism-ledger entries — `now-clock`,
`uuidv4-entropy`). The session-settings seam's default is a **fixed deterministic value** (`UTC`,
the empty variable map), so it needs **no** exception-ledger entry: it is the seam discipline
(host supplies it, injected for tests) *without* the nondeterminism. A host that points the time
zone at the OS zone owns that determinism consequence (the host-extension boundary, CLAUDE.md §13).

### 6.1 Session variables

✅ **Landed (all 3 cores, §10 slice 5).** PostgreSQL's GUC model, scoped to the session: a
**string→string** map (PG GUCs are all text),

- set via the host API (`session.set_var(name, value)` / `session.reset_var(name)`, read back with
  `session.var(name) -> Option<String>`),
- read in SQL via `current_setting('name'[, missing_ok])`.

Custom variables must be **namespaced** (contain a `.`, e.g. `myapp.tenant`) like PG, to stay
lexically disjoint from built-in settings. In v1 there is **no built-in reachable through this map**
(the `time_zone` built-in is its own slice, §6.2), so **only dotted names are settable** — `set_var`
/ `reset_var` of a non-dotted name is **`42704`** (the unknown-built-in case, PG's `SET bogus = …`).
`current_setting` on a name that is not set is **`42704`** (unrecognized configuration parameter)
unless the two-arg overload passes `missing_ok = true`, which returns **NULL**; `current_setting(NULL)`
is NULL (the function is **STABLE** and null-propagating). The host getter `var` never errors — an
unset name reads as `None`. Variables are **session state, not snapshot state**, so they do **not**
roll back with a transaction (PG `SET SESSION`; `SET LOCAL` is a deferred exception). Values affect
results (`current_setting` returns them), so the corpus pins them with a **`# set: name=value, …`**
directive (a stock-runner-ignored comment bound to the next record and reset after — like
`# seed:`/`# clock:`). Capability: `session.variables`.

**v1 scope (narrow hard, relax later):** the host-API get/set + the `current_setting()` SQL read.
The full SQL `SET`/`RESET`/`SHOW` grammar, `set_config()`, the `time_zone` built-in (§6.2, a separate
slice), and **`SET LOCAL`** transaction-scoped variables (which *do* roll back with their transaction)
are follow-ons (§10/§11).

### 6.2 Session time zone

The time zone is the one **built-in** session variable, `TimeZone`, defaulting to **`UTC`**. The
default is deliberately UTC, **not the host's local zone** — a fixed deterministic value (§6 above).

**Implemented** with the tz conversion slice ([timezones.md §9](timezones.md)): the slot is the zone a
`timestamptz` is **decomposed in** by `date_trunc` / `EXTRACT` / the cross-family datetime casts. It is
set through the **host API** (`set_time_zone` / `SessionOptions::time_zone` — Rust
`Session::set_time_zone`, Go `SetTimeZone`, TS `setTimeZone`), **validated against the loaded zone set**
(`UTC` and fixed numeric offsets like `+05:00` always; a **named** IANA zone now accepted when a loaded
`JTZ` bundle provides it — else **`22023`**, lifting the earlier `0A000`-on-named narrowing), and stored
as a resolved `ZoneRef`. There is **no SQL `SET TIME ZONE`** grammar yet (a follow-on), and the slot
drives *computation*, not yet `timestamptz`-*rendering* (timezones.md §9.5). Capability:
`session.timezone`; corpus directive `# timezone: <zone>`.

## 7. Errors

The session adds one code and reuses the rest:

| code | when |
|---|---|
| **`54P02 session_cost_limit_exceeded`** | the session's cumulative cost reached `lifetime_max_cost` (§5.4) — **new** |
| `54P01 cost_limit_exceeded` | a single statement reached `max_cost` (§5.2, existing) |
| `42501 insufficient_privilege` | a statement lacked a table privilege (`SELECT`/`INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE`), a function `EXECUTE` privilege, or DDL permission (§5.3) — existing PG code, new use |
| `25006` | a write against a physically read-only file / `READ ONLY` transaction (§5.1, existing) |
| `25P03 idle_in_transaction_session_timeout` | an open transaction sat idle past `idle_in_transaction_timeout` (§2.2) — existing PG code, deferred enforcement |
| `54000` | a statement (or a script's statement) exceeded `max_sql_length` (§4, existing) |
| `42704` | `current_setting` on an unknown setting without `missing_ok` (§6.1, existing) |

`54P02` is registered in [../errors/registry.toml](../errors/registry.toml) when the lifetime-cost
slice lands, modeled on `54P01` (a documented `P`-subclass divergence — PG has no execution-cost
ceiling, CLAUDE.md §1/§13).

## 8. Idiomatic mapping

Extends the [api.md §6](api.md) table; same shape across cores, idiomatic spelling per core.

| Concept / op | Rust | Go | TS |
|---|---|---|---|
| split statements *(top-level — not a `Session`/`Database` method)* | `jed::split_statements(sql) -> impl Iterator<Item = StatementSpan>` | `jed.SplitStatements(sql) iter.Seq[StatementSpan]` | `splitStatements(sql): Iterable<StatementSpan>` |
| open session | `db.session(opts) -> Session` | `db.Session(opts) (*Session, error)` | `session(db, opts): Session` |
| close session | `session.close()` + `Drop` | `session.Close() error` | `session.close(): void` |
| run a script | `session.execute_script(sql) -> Result<ScriptSummary>` | `session.ExecuteScript(sql) (ScriptSummary, error)` | `session.executeScript(sql): ScriptSummary` |
| set lifetime budget | `session.set_lifetime_max_cost(n)` | `session.SetLifetimeMaxCost(n)` | `session.setLifetimeMaxCost(n)` |
| cumulative cost gauge | `session.lifetime_cost() -> i64` | `session.LifetimeCost() int64` | `session.lifetimeCost: number` |
| default privileges | `SessionOptions { default_privileges }` | `SessionOptions{ DefaultPrivileges }` | `{ defaultPrivileges }` |
| grant / revoke | `session.grant(privs, on)` / `session.revoke(privs, on)` | `session.Grant` / `session.Revoke` | `session.grant` / `session.revoke` |
| allow DDL | `SessionOptions { allow_ddl }` | `SessionOptions{ AllowDDL }` | `{ allowDdl }` |
| set variable | `session.set_var(name, val)` / `reset_var` | `session.SetVar` / `ResetVar` | `session.setVar` / `resetVar` |
| read variable | `session.var(name) -> Option<String>` | `session.Var(name) (string, bool)` | `session.var(name): string \| undefined` |
| time zone | `SessionOptions { time_zone }` / `session.set_time_zone(z)` | `SessionOptions{ TimeZone }` / `SetTimeZone` | `{ timeZone }` / `setTimeZone` |

The settings already on the handle today — `max_cost`, `max_sql_length`, `work_mem`, the
random/clock sources ([api.md §6/§8/§10](api.md)) — relocate onto `Session` unchanged in shape
(the bare `Database` proxies them to its default session for back-compat). `read_only` is the one
exception: its *physical* form stays a `Database` open option ([api.md §2.1](api.md), `25006`),
and its session-level *authorization* role is superseded by the privilege model (§5.3, `42501`).

## 9. Determinism & the conformance contract

Both buckets are deterministic and corpus-testable, which is what keeps the session inside the
no-reference-implementation net (CLAUDE.md §2):

- **Envelope errors are deterministic** — a blocked table (`42501`), a per-statement ceiling
  (`54P01`), a lifetime budget (`54P02`) all fire at a deterministic, cross-core-identical point.
  The lifetime budget specifically is pinned by an ordered multi-statement schedule (the
  concurrency-suite style — [conformance.md](conformance.md)), since it is cumulative across
  statements and the single-record `# cost:` directive cannot express it.
- **Semantic settings are deterministic given the seam** — `# set:` / `# timezone:` inject fixed
  values, so a record that depends on a session variable or the zone is byte-identical across
  cores; defaults (`UTC`, empty map) are fixed, so an undecorated record is unaffected.

These are **per-impl API surface for the *mechanism*** (the `Session` object is not in the shared
corpus — [api.md §1](api.md)) but **shared-corpus for the *observable SQL behavior*** (the errors
and the `current_setting`/zone-dependent results). That split mirrors how `max_cost` is a per-impl
setter but `54P01` is a corpus-asserted outcome.

## 10. Slicing / delivery

Not one slice — a sequence of vertical slices (CLAUDE.md §10), each independently testable. Spec
(this doc) lands first; cores follow in lockstep:

1. **Session concept + the one stateful default session** — ✅ **landed (all 3 cores).** Un-fused
   `Database`/`Session`, relocated the settings onto `Session`, made the `Database`-owned default
   session explicit and stateful (§2.1) and the **transaction state machine** explicit on the session
   (`Idle`/`Open`/`Failed` = `TxStatus`/`db.status()`, §2.2) — collapsing the separate `Transaction`
   object into session state + RAII sugar. `db.session(opts)` mints additional sessions that share
   committed storage and run sequentially via a swap. Near-pure refactor — corpus + all suites
   unchanged (162/0 ×3, NoREC 660/660), per-core `session` tests added. (One per-core divergence: the
   TS `Session` exposes `execute` + settings + `status`; its `view`/`update` closure sugar is deferred
   to avoid an `api.ts` module cycle — TS drives an additional session's transactions via SQL
   `BEGIN`/`COMMIT` through `execute`.)
2. **Multi-statement splitter + `execute_script`** (§4) — ✅ **landed (all 3 cores).** The
   **library-level** lexer `split_statements` function (a top-level export, no `Session`/`Database`) + the session-level discard-rows /
   one-implicit-transaction `execute_script` convenience. Both are **host-API surface**, so both are
   **per-core unit tested** (the single-statement corpus can call neither, CLAUDE.md §10);
   `execute_script`'s atomicity rests on the already-corpus-covered transaction machinery, and the
   splitter adds no SQL semantics. v1 narrowing: an in-script `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK` is `0A000`
   (partitioning is a §11 follow-on). No new capability flag (nothing in the corpus gates on it).
3. **Privileges — the GRANT/REVOKE model** (§5.3) — ✅ **landed (all 3 cores).** Per-table
   `SELECT`/`INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE` + function `EXECUTE` + `allow_ddl`, collected by an exhaustive
   per-statement AST walk and enforced at the executor's `dispatch_stmt` seam with `42501` — DDL
   gated by `allow_ddl`, each table privilege required only for a name that **resolves to an existing
   catalog table** (a missing table stays `42P01`; a CTE / derived-table label is statement-local and
   skipped), each named function needing `EXECUTE`. A fully-permissive session (the default) skips the
   walk entirely, so the common path is untouched. The four `# default_privileges:` / `# grant:` /
   `# revoke:` / `# allow_ddl:` directives configure the session per record (reset after, like
   `# max_cost:`); the SQL-observable `42501` is **cross-core corpus-tested**
   (`suites/session/privileges.test`, jed-specific so not oracle-checked), the host-API surface
   (`grant`/`revoke`/`set_default_privileges`/`set_allow_ddl`, the additional-session envelope, the
   `Privilege`/`PrivilegeSet` value API) **per-core unit tested**. Registers `42501` in the registry;
   no on-disk format change (the envelope is session state, never persisted). Capabilities
   `session.privileges` / `session.allow_ddl`. **v1 narrowing beyond §5.3's two:** function `EXECUTE`
   defaults **on**, so only `revoke` disables a function (the deny-list — the determinism-pinning use
   case); a function *allow-list* (default-off + per-function grant) needs a function-default toggle
   the v1 option surface omits and is deferred (§11).
4. **Lifetime cost budget** (§5.4) — ✅ **landed (all 3 cores).** The session holds a running
   cumulative cost total (`lifetime_cost`); the per-statement `Meter` live-charges into it through a
   shared handle (`Rc<Cell<i64>>` / `*int64` / object reference), so **partial cost of an aborted
   statement counts automatically** and the cumulative is **session state, not snapshot state** (it
   does not roll back with a transaction). The instant the total reaches `lifetime_max_cost` the
   in-flight statement aborts `54P02`; a statement aborts at whichever ceiling it reaches first (its
   own `max_cost`/`54P01` or the session budget/`54P02`, the per-statement ceiling winning an exact
   tie). Once the budget is spent, every further statement is rejected `54P02` at **admission**
   (checked before privileges and before any work). The SQL-observable `54P02` (in-flight abort,
   admission rejection, `54P01`-vs-`54P02` precedence) is **cross-core corpus-tested** via a sticky
   `# lifetime_max_cost: N` directive over an ordered statement sequence on the one session
   (`suites/session/lifetime_cost.test`); the gauge / setters / no-rollback / partial-cost host-API
   surface is per-core unit tested. Capability `session.lifetime_cost`; registers `54P02`. No on-disk
   format change (the cumulative is session state, never persisted).
5. **Session variables** (§6.1, v1 scope) — ✅ **landed (all 3 cores).** The session holds a
   `string→string` map; the host sets it (`set_var`/`reset_var`, read back with `var`) and SQL reads
   it with the new **`current_setting('name'[, missing_ok])`** built-in (two overloads, STABLE,
   null-propagating — added to the function catalog and codegenned like every operator). Only dotted
   (namespaced) custom names are settable in v1 — a non-dotted name is `42704` (the unknown-built-in
   case, the `time_zone` built-in being slice 6); `current_setting` on an unset name is `42704` unless
   `missing_ok` is true (→ NULL). The map is **session state, not snapshot state** (it does not roll
   back with a transaction) and survives the additional-session swap (it is part of `Session`, like
   the privilege envelope). The SQL-observable `current_setting` behavior is **cross-core
   corpus-tested** via a per-record `# set: name=value, …` directive (`suites/session/variables.test`,
   jed-specific so not oracle-checked); the host-API surface (`set_var`/`reset_var`/`var`, the
   `42704`-on-non-dotted, additional-session isolation, the no-rollback) is **per-core unit tested**.
   Reuses `42704` (no new error code); no on-disk format change (session state, never persisted). No
   grammar change (the SQL `SET`/`SHOW` surface is a §11 follow-on). Capability `session.variables`.
6. **Session time zone slot** (§6.2) — the `time_zone` built-in (default `UTC`; `UTC` + fixed offsets
   + **named loaded zones**, `22023` otherwise), the `# timezone:` directive. Capability
   `session.timezone`. The consumers (`date_trunc` / `EXTRACT` / cross-family casts) landed with the tz
   conversion slice ([timezones.md §9](timezones.md)): the slot is the zone a `timestamptz` decomposes in.
7. **Convergence with the shared handle** (§2.4) — fold `SharedDb`/`ReadHandle`/`WriteHandle` into
   `Database` + `Session` so a session *is* the configured concurrency handle. Decided shape (this
   doc): **full rename** (`SharedDb`→`Database`, the old executor handle→`Engine`), **unified
   PG-like sessions** (one writable session, lazy gate on first write), **file-backed included**.
   Sub-slices, all three cores in lockstep, the rename landed as its own commit so the semantic diff
   is reviewable:
   - **7a — rename only.** `Database`→`Engine`, `SharedDb`→`Database`, no semantic change; green ×3.
   - **7b — in-memory convergence.** ✅ **landed (all 3 cores)** — the handle convergence + the
     additional-session fold-in. The envelope type renamed `Session`→`SessionState` (an internal type
     an `Engine` owns as `engine.session`); the **unified `Session`** is now the host handle — the §3
     envelope + a private `Engine` + an access mode — minted by **`db.read_session()`** (READ ONLY,
     pinned, registered in the watermark, a write is `25006` — the old `ReadHandle`),
     **`db.write_session()`** (READ WRITE with an eager open write block — the BEGIN READ WRITE form,
     §2.4 — the old `WriteHandle`), and **`db.session(opts)`** (a configured session running
     **autocommit with the lazy gate**: an autocommit read pins the latest committed for that one
     statement, an autocommit write takes the gate per statement / publishes / releases, and
     `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK` open and end an explicit block — the old `Engine::session(opts)` swap,
     now owning its own `Engine`). The `activate`/swap is **deleted**; `ReadHandle`/`WriteHandle` are
     **folded into `Session`**. Migrated the concurrency conformance driver (`read()/write()`→
     `read_session()/write_session()`, the read/write enum collapsed to one type), the stress harness,
     and the `shared`/`session`/`privileges`/`execute_script`/`lifetime_cost`/`variables` per-core
     tests. Corpus + results **byte-identical** (281×3); the threaded concurrency suites still pass
     under the Go/Rust race detector. No new capability flags, no on-disk format change.
     **Scope note (refines this plan):** the **`Database`-level default-session delegators**
     (`db.execute`/`db.query`/`db.begin`/`db.status`/`db.execute_script`) move to **7c** — they are
     load-bearing only once `open`/`create` return a `Database` (the bare single-handle path is still
     `Engine` through 7b), and folding them in there keeps the primary-handle shape (and, in Rust, the
     `Send`/`Sync` boundary — `Database` stays `Arc<Shared>`, the `!Send` `Session` is minted per
     thread) decided in one place. Through 7b the bare `Engine` remains the single-handle path,
     unchanged.
   - **7c — file-backed sessions + the default-session bridge.** Thread-safe pager/buffer-pool under
     concurrent reader faults, and **watermark-gated page reclamation** (transactions.md §8);
     `open`/`create` return the shared `Database`, and the **default-session delegators**
     (`db.execute`/`db.query`/`db.begin`/`db.status`/`db.execute_script`, §2.1/§2.4) land here as the
     back-compat single-handle bridge over that `Database`. Add the `Database` concurrent-reader bench
     ([../../TODO.md](../../TODO.md)).
   - **7d — docs.** `web/src/routes/docs/api/*`, `web/examples/*`; the worker bridge keeps the
     single-handle path via the delegators.

   No new capability flags (the concurrency corpus suites and their results are unchanged). The
   simple/fast single-handle path stays cheap (an autocommit read is one snapshot pin; an autocommit
   write is one uncontended gate acquire) — guarded by the new concurrent-reader bench.

## 11. Open / deferred (none foreclosed)

- **`execute_script` transaction partitioning** — the PG-simple-query semantics where an in-script
  `COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK` partitions a multi-statement run into separately-committed segments (and an
  in-script `BEGIN` opens a nested explicit block inside the implicit wrapper). v1 rejects **all**
  in-script transaction control with `0A000` (§4.2) — clean and well-defined — and leaves the
  partitioning state machine, which must reconcile the implicit wrapper with an in-script `BEGIN`,
  for a later slice. The §4.1 `split_statements` loop is the escape hatch in the meantime.
- **`idle_in_transaction_timeout` enforcement** — the setting slot is defined (§2.2/§3); the
  background auto-rollback of an idle open transaction + the `25P03` abort is a deferred slice (it
  needs a clock read on the §6 seam, so its trigger stays deterministic-given-the-clock).
- **A streaming multi-result reader is *not* a special API** — a host that wants the rows of every
  statement in a multi-statement run loops `split_statements` (§4.1) and consumes each
  `session.query` cursor itself; nothing further is owed. (The cursor's own pull-streaming is the
  separate [spill.md](spill.md) / [api.md §4](api.md) work.)
- **`SET LOCAL` / transaction-scoped variables** — variables that roll back at transaction end
  (PG `SET LOCAL`); v1 variables are session-scoped only (§6.1).
- **Full SQL `SET`/`RESET`/`SHOW` grammar + `set_config()`** — v1 exposes the host API + the
  `time_zone` built-in; the general SQL surface is a follow-on (§6.1).
- **Named time zones + a tz database** — v1 accepts `UTC` and fixed offsets only (§6.2); named
  zones (`America/New_York`) need a tz database (a separate, large feature).
- **Column-level privileges + a CREATE/ownership privilege** — PG has per-*column* `GRANT` and
  models DDL via `CREATE`-on-schema + ownership; v1 gates whole base-table + named-function names
  and folds all DDL under one `allow_ddl` boolean (§5.3).
- **Function `EXECUTE` allow-list (default-off)** — v1 functions default `EXECUTE`-on, so only
  `revoke` disables one (the deny-list, §5.3); the symmetric allow-list (default-off + per-function
  `grant`) needs a function-level default toggle the v1 `SessionOptions` does not carry. A small
  additive option when wanted.
- **Per-statement setting overrides** — an options object on `execute`/`prepare` overriding a
  session setting for one call (the [api.md §8](api.md) "per-call override stays open" note),
  unchanged by this doc.
